Horizon 2020,DDX TRANSIT,DEAD-box ATPases as master regulators of phase-separated compartments to control cellular RNA flux and the remodeling of RNA-protein complexes,"Life ultimately depends on the tight control of gene expression, which requires an ordered and efficient processing of various RNA molecules. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) – bound by a constantly changing coat of passenger proteins - transit from transcription in the nucleus to translation and ultimately decay in the cytoplasm. Similarly, ribosomal rRNAs migrate through the nucleolus where they gradually en-counter ribosomal proteins to assemble functional ribosomes. Still, we know very little about the pro-cesses that orchestrate this flux of RNA in a temporal and spatial manner.
Intriguingly, many RNA processing steps occur in membraneless organelles formed by liquid-liquid phase separation, e.g. nuclear speckles or the nucleolus, but the function of condensate formation in RNA processing is not known. I have discovered that the family of DEAD-box ATPases (DDXs) are master regulators of RNA-containing membraneless organelles, from bacteria to man. DDXs use their low-complexity domains and ATPase activity to regulate condensate dynamics and RNA flux through these compartments.
I propose that cells use DDX-controlled condensate ‘stations’ to establish an RNA ‘transit map’ to reg-ulate the cellular flux of mRNA and rRNA molecules and to spatially and temporally control RNA pro-cessing. In three work packages, I will (1) characterize central DDXs that control mRNA flux and use DDX mutants as unique tools to map passenger protein changes along the life of an mRNA; (2) charac-terize how DDXs regulate the formation of the phase-separated nucleolar environment and facilitate the flux of rRNA during ribosome assembly; (3) dissect how DDX condensates function as biomolecular filters to selectively enrich or exclude proteins, and how selectivity contributes to the remodeling of the RNA protein coat and directional RNA flux.

Horizon 2020,DestCilia,Destination cilium: towards selective probing and perturbation of ciliary signaling,"The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle that organizes a variety of cellular signaling pathways. Its importance for human health is illustrated by a large collection of cilium-based diseases, the ciliopathies, caused by mutations that alter cilium formation, structure, and function. Importantly, the mammalian Hedgehog signaling pathway is critically dependent on the primary cilium, dysregulation of which contributes to severe developmental defects and a variety of cancers. The ultimate goal of this work program is to enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ciliary signaling in health and disease. This is accomplished through the development of advanced technologies that provide a currently unattainable level of spatiotemporal control over ciliary proteins in mammalian cells. Unraveling the mechanisms by which the ciliary compartment orchestrates signal transduction is challenging, because ciliary and cytoplasmic roles of proteins involved in signal transduction are tightly connected, difficult to resolve and, importantly, context-specific. Here, an innovative chemical biology program is presented that provides a powerful toolbox to overcome these challenges, allowing the intraciliary manipulation, and therefore study, of ciliary proteins. Combining chemical probes, synthetic ciliary targeting approaches, and a modular enzymatic tagging strategy, this program provides unprecedented opportunities to probe, visualize, inhibit or degrade proteins at specific times and selectively within the ciliary compartment. Specifically, these tools will be used to decipher the relationships between tubulin acetylation state, intraflagellar transport, and Hedgehog signal transduction in wild-type and ciliopathy-mutant cells. These innovative work packages synergistically provide enhanced fundamental understanding of ciliary signaling, and pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches to combat cilium-based diseases.",Sascha Hoogendoorn,University of Geneva,Switzerland,-,948750,ERC-2020-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS1 - Molecules of Life: Biological Mechanisms, Structures & Functions",2020,44197,46173,1408776,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/948750,University of Geneva
Horizon 2020,BRCA INSIGHTS,Understanding the functions of the BRCA protein complexes in DNA break repair and in replication stress,"BRCA1, BRCA2 and associated factors are frequently mutated in familial and sporadic cancers of the breast and ovary. The BRCA proteins have canonical functions together with the RAD51 recombinase in DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination. More recently, it was discovered that the same proteins have separate, recombination-independent roles in the metabolism of challenged replication forks. It is currently debated whether defects in the canonical and/or non-canonical functions of BRCA contribute to tumorigenesis. 

As BRCA1 and BRCA2 function in various processes, interact with numbers of co-factors, and can be extensively post-translationally modified, phenotypes associated with their defects are often very pleiotropic. Here I propose to use a biochemical approach, which will allow us to study the precise functions of these proteins with defined substrates and co-factors in controlled systems. BRCA1 and BRCA2 represent some of the largest factors in human proteome. Using state-of-the-art protein expression strategies, we are now able to produce sufficient quantities of the respective complexes in their native or post-translationally modified states to make biochemistry feasible. 

We aim to define how the BRCA proteins help couple the initial steps in DNA break repair including nucleolytic processing of DNA breaks, RAD51 loading on ssDNA and subsequent invasion of homologous DNA template. We will also determine the precise non-canonical functions of RAD51, RAD52 and BRCA1/2 complexes in fork remodeling, fork protection and fork restart, which prevents pathological degradation of nascent DNA under replication stress. We anticipate that these diverse functions of BRCA proteins are governed by their co-factors, post-translational modifications and specific substrates. A biochemical approach is uniquely suited to understand the mechanisms how BRCA proteins regulate DNA metabolic pathways to promote genome stability and prevent tumorigenesis.

Horizon 2020,mARs,"mARs: Mobile DNA driven antibiotic resistance spreading: molecular strategies, control and evolution for broad distribution","Antibiotic resistance (AR) is spreading rapidly, leading to the development of highly virulent pathogens and multidrug-resistant ‘superbugs’, a major health concern of our era. Mobile DNA elements, transposons and integrons, effectively drive the spread of AR genes in microbial interaction hotspots, such as bacterial communities in humans and natural environments. Yet, our knowledge of their mechanisms remains very sparse. It is unclear how DNA movement occurs on the molecular level and how it is controlled in cells and communities; biochemical and structural data are rare and our view on their diversity and evolution is limited. Here I propose an integrated approach combining bioinformatics, genetics, microbiology, biochemistry, and structural biology to elucidate the mechanisms and diversity of mobile DNA driven resistance spreading. I want to (a) investigate the molecular mechanisms and regulation of AR gene movement in vitro, in model bacteria and in gut bacterial communities; (b) dissect the structure of the underlying molecular machineries to reveal how protein-DNA interplay promotes gene transfer; and (c) characterize the diversity, evolution and functional success of distinct molecular pathways. Mechanistic work will focus on selected mobile elements that confer resistance to last resort drugs and promiscuous gene carriers with high prevalence in health care. Bioinformatic quests will draw on recent (meta)genomic data to chart the clinical significance of molecular insights in situ. By bridging disciplines, I want to provide functionally annotated molecular movies of gene movement and explain how specific molecular strategies evolved to enable broad dissemination of resistance determinants. The insights gained in this research will provide in-depth knowledge on major AR transfer pathways and will have key implications for the development of novel intervention strategies and preventive measures aimed at reducing dissemination of drug resistance in bacteria.",Orsolya Barabas,University of Geneva,Switzerland,-,866250,ERC-2019-COG,Consolidator Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS1 - Molecules of Life: Biological Mechanisms, Structures & Functions",2019,44378,46203,1999118,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/866250,University of Geneva
Horizon 2020,NucEM,Accessing Nucleosomal DNA,"Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression and govern cell identity. In chromatinised genomes TF binding sites are frequently encapsulated in nucleosomes, which severely restrict access. While specialised pioneer factors have been proposed to bind to these sterically hindered sites, the exact mechanism by which these factors access nucleosomes remains unknown. A number of biochemical models have been put forward that would allow DNA sequence read-out, these include: (i) TFs compatible with the nucleosome architecture, (ii) alternative, partial, DNA motifs that render TFs nucleosome compatible, (iii) exposure of DNA binding sites through histone-nucleosome breathing dynamics, or (iv) remodelling of the histone core by TF binding. Despite being a fundamental question in genome regulation, no structural rationale is currently available for any of these proposed mechanisms. In unpublished work, we developed a novel biochemical assay allowing to simultaneously investigate all DNA registers on a nucleosome for TF access. This tool enabled us to solve the 3.8 Å structure OCT4/SOX2 bound to a nucleosome revealing the unexpected binding modes these TFs employ to engage nucleosomal binding sites (unpublished). Building on this novel biochemical workflow, we propose to solve additional structures of TFs compatible with the nucleosome-architecture and of those TFs suspected to bind to the ends of nucleosomal DNA. By dissecting multiple structures with diverse DNA binding domains in vitro and in cells, we wish to understand general principles of how DNA sequence motifs are being read-out at different sites on a nucleosome.  The key questions we wish to address are: How does the location of a TF motif on a nucleosome impact affinity and/or the binding mechanism? Can TF binding remodel the nucleosome architecture? How do arrays of nucleosomes impact TF accessibility to DNA?  ",Nicolas Thoma,Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research,Switzerland,-,884331,ERC-2019-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS1 - Molecules of Life: Biological Mechanisms, Structures & Functions",2019,44256,46081,2100929,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/884331,Institute Friedrich Miescher
Horizon 2020,CRISPR2.0,Microbial genome defence pathways: from molecular mechanisms to next-generation molecular tools,"The constant arms race between prokaryotic microbes and their molecular parasites such as viruses, plasmids and transposons has driven the evolution of complex genome defence mechanisms. The CRISPR-Cas defence systems provide adaptive RNA-guided immunity against invasive nucleic acid elements. CRISPR-associated effector nucleases such as Cas9, Cas12a and Cas13 have emerged as powerful tools for precision genome editing, gene expression control and nucleic acid detection. However, these technologies suffer from drawbacks that limit their efficacy and versatility, necessitating the search for additional exploitable molecular activities. Building on our recent structural and biochemical studies, the goal of this project is to investigate the molecular architectures and mechanisms of CRISPR-associated systems and other genome defence mechanisms, aiming not only to shed light on their biological roles but also inform their technological development. Specifically, the proposed studies will examine (i) the molecular basis of cyclic oligoadenylate signalling in type III CRISPR-Cas systems, (ii) the mechanism of transposon-associated type I CRISPR-Cas systems and their putative function in RNA-guided DNA transposition, and (iii) molecular activities associated with recently described non-CRISPR defence systems. Collectively, the proposed studies will advance our understanding of the molecular functions of genome defence mechanisms in shaping the evolution of prokaryotic genomes and make critical contributions to their development as novel genetic engineering tools.",Martin Jinek,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,820152,ERC-2018-COG,Consolidator Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS1 - Molecules of Life: Biological Mechanisms, Structures & Functions",2018,43586,45961,1996525,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/820152,University of Zurich
Horizon 2020,INSPIRE,System-wide discovery and analysis of inositol pyrophosphate signaling networks in plants,"Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are soluble signaling molecules known to play diverse roles in fungal and animal cell signaling. The metabolism of PP-InsPs in plants however is poorly understood and many signaling pathways controlled by PP-InsPs remain to be discovered. Funded by an ERC starting grant, we have previously identified protein sensor domains for PP-InsPs, which allow PP-InsPs to act as central regulators of phosphate homeostasis in all eukaryotes. Genetic disruption of PP-InsP synthesis results in dramatic phenotypes in the model plant Arabidopsis, which however cannot be rationalized by defects in phosphate signaling only. Based on these physiological observations, we generated a system-wide Arabidopsis PP-InsP interactome, using an affinity-matrix absorbed non-hydrolyzable PP-InsP analog. Surprisingly, hundreds of novel candidates from different protein families were identified in this screen, now enabling us to study PP-InsP catabolism and a multitude of PP-InsP-mediated signaling processes. Here, I propose to combine quantitative biochemistry and structural biology with cell biology and genome editing to dissect plant PP-InsP signaling networks at the physiological level and in mechanistic detail. Specifically, we will define the roles for PP-InsPs in plant light sensing and signaling, in flowering time regulation and in plant immune responses. Our ultimate goal will be to investigate the cross-talk between different PP-InsP-controlled signaling pathways and to define central signaling hubs. I envision that the work outlined in this proposal will yield a mechanistically validated system’s-level view of PP-InsP signal transduction in plants, which may allow us to better understand how plants develop and interact with their environment, and that may enable us to improve crop performance in the future.",Michael Hothorn,University of Geneva,Switzerland,-,818696,ERC-2018-COG,Consolidator Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS1 - Molecules of Life: Biological Mechanisms, Structures & Functions",2018,43617,45808,1781251,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/818696,University of Geneva
Horizon 2020,TENDO,Tension of ENDOmembranes maintained by TORC1,"The target of the bacterial macrolide rapamycin, TOR, is a ser/thr protein kinase that assembles into two distinct protein complexes, conserved from yeast to human, we named TORC1 and TORC2. TORC1 is directly bound and inhibited by rapamycin and studies with rapamycin have revealed that TORC1 plays a central role in coupling nutrient cues to biomass synthesis and turnover. The lack of a specific inhibitor for TORC2 has made the study of this complex much more challenging. We overcame this challenge by solving the structure of yeast TORC2 which revealed why it is insensitive to rapamycin and enabled us to create a rapamycin-sensitive TORC2 variant. We also developed two small molecules, one that dissipates plasma membrane (PM) tension and the other that serves as a biosensor of PM tension. With this suite of chemical-biology tools we confirmed that TORC2 functions in a mechanotransduction pathway to maintain tension homeostasis of the PM. Concurrently, solving the structure of TORC1 revealed that its activity is regulated via assembly into a huge, inactive helix which we named a TOROID – TORC1 Organized in an Inactive Domain. In this grant, was ask if these major advances are transferable; i.e. can lessons learned regarding TORC2 be applied to TORC1, and vice versa? Our major aim is to determine if and how TORC1 regulates vacuolar membrane (VM) tension. To this end, we will develop novel chemical probes to monitor VM tension and we will use genetic screens, quantitative phosphoproteomics, in vitro assays, high-throughput compound screens, STORM and FRAP imaging, and state-of-the-art cryo-EM to learn how TORC1 senses and regulates VM tension. Our other aim, prompted by our TOROID discovery, is to solve the TOROID-like structure that TORC2 forms upon glucose depletion. This work will reveal new mechanisms in growth control, and details in TORC1 and TORC2 regulation that may inform future therapeutic interventions for these medically relevant signalling complexes.",Robbie Joseph Loewith,University of Geneva,Switzerland,-,834394,ERC-2018-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS1 - Molecules of Life: Biological Mechanisms, Structures & Functions",2018,43586,45596,2257546,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/834394,University of Geneva
Horizon 2020,ORISPECIFICATION,Molecular and structural mechanisms for metazoan replication origin specification,"Cellular life depends on the timely and accurate duplication of chromosomal DNA through semi-conservative replication to sustain genomic integrity and organismal viability. In all domains of life, DNA replication relies on dedicated initiator proteins that recognize and bind specific genomic sites, termed replication origins, to facilitate the loading of ring-shaped replicative helicases onto DNA. While origin recognition by initiators is determined by specific DNA sequences in prokaryotes and in the eukaryote S. cerevisiae, origin specification in higher eukaryotes instead appears to rely on chromatin context and DNA structure. Yet, how initiators help specify replication origins at the molecular level and how their binding sites are established in higher eukaryotes remain foremost and long-standing questions in the field. This research proposal focuses on uncovering the molecular and structural principles for chromosomal binding site selection by the eukaryotic initiator, the origin recognition complex (ORC), in metazoan systems. Employing integrated biochemical, structural, and cell-based approaches, we aim to 1) elucidate how ORC binds DNA and how DNA structural elements contribute to this interaction, 2) determine how nucleosomes are recognized by ORC, and 3) identify auxiliary binding partners of ORC and establish how they contribute to origin specification. The outcomes of our proposed efforts will have far-reaching implications for multiple scientific fields by defining mechanistic links between chromatin architecture and DNA replication initiation, and they will set the foundation to understand at the molecular level how the replication initiation program is altered during cell differentiation and development. Our studies also have significant biomedical relevance, as failure to precisely replicate chromosomal DNA leads to genetic instability, which in turn underpins many human diseases, including cancer and certain developmental disorders.",Franziska Bleichert,Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research,Switzerland,-,757909,ERC-2017-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS1 - Molecules of Life: Biological Mechanisms, Structures & Functions",2017,43282,45107,1500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/757909,Institute Friedrich Miescher
Horizon 2020,IMMUNO-PEPTALK,Regulation of plant receptor kinase-mediated immunity by endogenous peptides and their receptors,"Plant receptor kinases are major pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that function as part of dynamic multimeric complexes to perceive pathogen-associated molecular patterns or host-derived damage-associated molecular patterns at the plasma membrane (PM). Our long-term objective is to decipher the molecular basis of plant innate immunity and to understand how plant receptor kinases work. Our recent findings point to an important role of endogenous peptides in the regulation of plant innate immune signaling. The main aim of this proposal is to understand how these endogenous peptides and their corresponding receptors regulate plant innate immune signaling. The central hypotheses of this research are that: (i) a subset of plant endogenous peptides are perceived by receptor kinases to fine-tune dynamically plant innate immune signaling, and thus act as ‘phytocytokines’; (ii) these phytocytokines and their receptors regulate the formation of active immune-signaling nanoclusters at the PM; and (iii) phytocytokine receptors participate in the sensory continuum represented by the plant PM and the cell wall to respond dynamically to environmental challenges. We will pursue the following specific objectives: (1) decipher the regulation, function, and perception of RALF peptides by malectin-like receptor kinases during immunity; (2) elucidate the formation, composition, and function of PM immune receptor nanoclusters; (3) reveal the function of the receptor kinase MIK2 and its ligand(s) in immunity. Through a balanced combination of straight-forward and high risk/high gain biochemical, biophysical, bioimaging, and genetics approaches, this project will provide groundbreaking insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment and regulation of plant innate immune signaling, but also into the general mechanisms that control plant receptor kinase functions and by which the myriad endogenous peptides encoded by plant genomes control environmental sensing.",Cyril Boris Zipfel,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,773153,ERC-2017-COG,Consolidator Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS1 - Molecules of Life: Biological Mechanisms, Structures & Functions",2017,43252,45260,1999999,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/773153,University of Zurich
Horizon 2020,MycoRailway,Discovery and molecular investigation of mycobacterial transporters responsible for iron acquisition,"To infect humans, the devastating pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis critically depends on two closely related siderophores – soluble carboxymycobactin and membrane-bound mycobactin – which capture iron with high affinity inside the host cell. Despite their undisputed importance for virulence, little is known about how these siderophores are exported and imported across the two mycobacterial membranes.Building on my lab’s experience in elucidating transport processes of pathogenic bacteria, we will unravel the molecular mechanism of an unusual ABC exporter which is thought to import iron-loaded siderophores across the inner mycobacterial membrane and to release iron in the cytoplasm by virtue of its attached siderophore interacting domain. Further, we will investigate two proton-driven transporters responsible for the efflux of empty siderophores, exhibiting an unknown protein fold. We will determine atomic structures by combining X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM and thoroughly investigate active in- and efflux of siderophores in liposomes as well as in cells. Siderophore transport across the outer mycobacterial membrane is a terra incognita. By combining high-density transposon mutagenesis with deep sequencing (Tn-Seq), we aim to discover novel receptors, carriers and channels involved in siderophore transport, which are subsequently characterized at the biochemical and structural level. Siderophore-mediated iron acquisition offers a vulnerable attacking point of M. tuberculosis. Using protein engineering, we will develop a human siderocalin exhibiting low affinity binding for carboxymycobactin into a therapeutic agent able to efficiently capture mycobacterial siderophores and thereby starve M. tuberculosis for iron. In summary, we will discover novel proteins involved in iron acquisition, gain mechanistic insights into poorly understood siderophore transport processes at the molecular level and explore novel strategies to treat tuberculosis.",Markus Andreas Seeger,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,772190,ERC-2017-COG,Consolidator Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS1 - Molecules of Life: Biological Mechanisms, Structures & Functions",2017,43191,45382,1999865,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/772190,University of Zurich
Horizon 2020,REPLISTRESS,DNA Replication: From Physiology to Replication Stress in Human Cancer,"Replication of the genome is of critical importance for cell proliferation and organismal development. To ensure accurate and complete replication of their genome, eukaryotes have hundreds to thousands of replication origins. In budding yeast, the genomic positions of all the origins are known, as is the order in which they fire. In contrast, in human cells, the mapping of origins is controversial and origin firing may be stochastic and plastic. Furthermore, while normal cells replicate their genomes with high fidelity; in cancer cells, the presence of activated oncogenes leads to collapse of DNA replication forks (DNA replication stress), DNA damage and genomic instability.My laboratory has recently elucidated key differences in DNA replication after oncogene induction. We mapped replication origins on the human genome and found that, in addition to the origins present before oncogene induction, a new class of “oncogene-induced” origins was observed upon activation of the CCNE1 (Cyclin E) or MYC (c-Myc) genes. Only forks from the oncogene-induced origins were prone to collapse, leading to the genomic instability patterns observed in the common human cancers.In this proposal, we aim to map with high precision the human replication origins, determine if their firing is stochastic or deterministic and identify sequence motifs that are important for origin firing (Aim 1). We further aim to explore how transcription in the G1 phase of the cell cycle regulates origin firing (Aim 2). This endeavour is motivated by our observation that transcription in G1 inactivates intragenic origins. Finally, we aim to understand how transcription, replication and repair are coordinated to avoid DNA replication stress in normal cells (Aim 3).The proposed experiments will help us understand how normal cells replicate their genome with high fidelity and how oncogenes interfere with this process.",Athanassios Dimitrios Halazonetis,University of Geneva,Switzerland,-,788681,ERC-2017-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS1 - Molecules of Life: Biological Mechanisms, Structures & Functions",2017,43374,45565,2231378,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/788681,University of Geneva
Horizon 2020,Precision Motifs,Analysis of functional tissue motifs for precision medicine in metastatic breast cancer,"Cancer precision medicine aims to bring the right drug (or right drug combination) to the right person. To achieve this, the molecular cause of an individual’s disease must be identified and a treatment chosen that targets that cause to remedy the dysfunction. Tumors are dynamic ecosystems with high heterogeneity in tumor, immune, and stromal cell compartments. This complexity is the main obstacle to implementation of precision medicine. Consequently, approaches that rationalize and use tumor ecosystems for precision medicine are needed. To enable this, I propose to establish the concept of functional tissue motif, a multiscale network representation of multi-cellular assemblies that executes a definable set of anti-tumor or pro-tumor functional outputs. The utility of functional tissue motifs for precision medicine will be demonstrated in the context of metastatic breast cancer, which causes nearly 450,000 cancer-associated deaths each year. We will develop a highly multiplexed 3D tissue imaging approach with unprecedented throughput that provides subcellular resolution to analyze a large cohort of primary and matched metastatic tumors. We will then use viable tumor samples ex vivo to systematically perturb intra-cellular and inter-cellular network wiring using approved drugs, and the drug effects will be measured by highly multiplexed imaging. Functional tissue motifs will be identified using community and geostatistical methods and probabilistic network modeling. Analysis of functional tissue motifs in the light of the clinical data will be used to derive a novel classification system and to identify vulnerabilities in metastatic breast tumors. These vulnerabilities will be validated in follow-up experiments and in a clinical study.

Horizon 2020,Proteomes-in-3D,Three-dimensional dynamic views of proteomes as a novel readout for physiological and pathological alterations,"Protein expression screens are routinely used to identify biological processes deregulated upon disease development or upon specific cellular perturbations. Generating molecular hypotheses from these ‘omic data remains challenging, however, and many molecular events that modulate protein function do not involve altered protein levels. With this project, I propose a new paradigm. I propose that by measuring altered structures of proteins on a global scale, we can capture altered functional states of proteins and proteomes. I propose that the new approach will support the generation of testable molecular hypotheses from global data and the development of new frameworks for the modelling of biological systems. 

Building on a unique mass spectrometric approach my lab developed, which captures protein structural changes on a proteome-wide scale, we will assess the performance of the global structural readout at analyzing complex phenotypes. We will apply it to a biomedical problem of interest to my lab: the functional and pathological implications of protein aggregates or superassemblies (SAs). 

Protein aggregates form not only during disease but also under physiological conditions. These structures regulate important normal processes and contribute to cellular architecture. Using the new structural approach, we will identify and characterize networks of novel functional SAs in E. coli, mouse, and human proteomes. We will assess how genomic variation, environment and age modulate protein structures and SA assembly and how SAs are linked to phenotypes. Last, we will translate our approach to a clinical setting and ask whether altered protein structures can serve as biomarkers of disease, specifically Parkinson’s disease and how SAs underlie Parkinson’s subtypes. We will collect the wealth of dynamic structural data generated through this project into an Atlas of Structural Proteome Dynamics and use the data to shed new light on features of the structural proteome.

Horizon 2020,CROSSINGSCALES,Reverse Scale-Crossing Effects In Biology,"The central dogma in biology often invokes a bottom-up picture of life. However, at different biological scales, new properties in form and function arise that have a superseding causal impact on the behaviour of the lower-scale components from which these new properties emerge. These top-down or reverse scale-crossing effects must be taken into account in order to make predictions about spatiotemporally controlled single-cell fates, activities, levels of gene expression, or the functional outcome of cellular signalling. They can stem from the multicellular, the cellular, and the intracellular scale, and can be quantified using multiscale and multiplexed RNA and protein state imaging in combination with computer vision and data-driven modelling. The ability to comprehensively map these reverse causal effects across multiple scales has the potential to revolutionize most, if not all domains of biology and medicine. In this project, we will establish the importance of reverse causal effects in human induced pluripotent stem cells and early D. rerio embryos. To achieve this, we will develop a quantitative imaging method beyond the diffraction limit of light without compromising scalability in temporal and spatial dimensions. We will also develop a method that achieves scalable, transcriptome-wide image-based multiplexing of mRNA transcripts, and we will extend our computer vision approaches to higher resolution and to three spatial dimensions. These methods will be systematically applied to stem cell collectives grown in 2D and 3D, as well as to early embryos, achieving comprehensive quantification of nuclear and chromatin states, gene expression, subcellular organization, cellular states, and tissue-scale organization across millions of individual cells within the same dataset.

Horizon 2020,DNAccess,Overcoming chromatin restricted DNA access,"Differential gene expression programs account for the diversity of cell types in our body. They are controlled by intricate networks of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) that operate in the context of chromatin. Chromatin is itself an essential component of this process, and is part of the system that selectively restricts DNA access for TFs. As a consequence, most TFs only bind to a small subset of their motif occurrences, in a way we currently do not fully understand. Our inability to predict binding of a TF based on its cognate motif and location in the genome is a serious obstacle towards predictive models of gene regulation.
DNAccess has the ambitious goal to define in vivo the sensitivities of TFs to nucleosomes and their reliance on chromatin remodeling enzymes for binding. Using novel genomics and genome editing tools we will: (a) systematically vary TF motifs, presence of nucleosomes and their modifications at a defined chromosomal locus and quantify resulting TF binding; (b) explore genome-wide the ability of ectopic TFs to engage with a chromatinized genome in the absence of host cofactor engagement; (c) dissect chromatin remodeler dependent TF binding in order to define temporal order and subcomplex function and (d) deconstruct remodeler recruitment by mutating TF interaction domains. 
DNAccess will build a highly integrated setup to comprehensively characterize how nucleosomes, their modifications and mobility restricts genome access. We will characterize existing chromatin barriers and identify how TFs overcome them. This represents a crucial step towards a comprehensive understanding of the role of chromatin in gene regulation, and will advance our understanding of how specificity is generated in large eukaryotic genomes.",Dirk Schubeler,Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research,Switzerland,-,884664,ERC-2019-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),LS2 - Integrative Biology: From Genes & Genomes to Systems,2019,44256,46081,2302500,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/884664,Institute Friedrich Miescher

However, it has been difficult to assess the functional effects of these genetic changes due to the lack of cell culture systems that recapitulate great ape organ complexity. Human and chimpanzee pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can self-organize into three-dimensional (3D) tissues that recapitulate the morphology, function, and genetic programs controlling organ development. Our vision is to use organoids to study the changes that set modern humans apart from our closest evolutionary relatives as well as all other organisms on the planet. In ANTHROPOID we will generate a great ape developmental cell atlas using cortex, liver, and small intestine organoids. We will use single-cell transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility to identify cell type-specific features of transcriptome divergence at cellular resolution. We will dissect enhancer evolution using single-cell genomic screens and ancestralize human cells to resurrect pre-human cellular phenotypes. ANTHROPOID utilizes quantitative and state-of-the-art methods to explore exciting high-risk questions at multiple branches of the modern human lineage.

Horizon 2020,EPICROP,Dissecting epistasis for enhanced crop productivity,"A major goal in plant biology is to understand how naturally occurring genetic variation leads to quantitative differences in economically important traits. Efforts to navigate the genotype-to-phenotype map are often focused on linear genetic interactions. As a result, crop breeding is mainly driven by loci with predictable additive effects. However, it has become clear that quantitative trait variation often results from perturbations of complex genetic networks. Thus, understanding epistasis, or interactions between genes, is key for our ability to predictably improve crops. To meet this challenge, this project will reveal and dissect epistatic interactions in gene regulatory networks that guide stem cell differentiation in the model crop tomato. In the first aim, I will utilize exhaustive allelic series for epistatic MADS-box genes that quantitatively regulate flower and fruit production as an experimental model system to study fundamental principles of epistasis that can be applied to other genetic networks. Genome-wide transcript profiling will be used to reveal molecular signatures of epistasis and potential targets for predictable crop improvement by advanced CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. Further, my preliminary data suggests that epistasis is widespread and important across major productivity traits in tomato. Thus, in a second aim, I will access this untapped resource of cryptic genetic variation by sensitizing a tomato diversity panel for weak epistatic effects from unknown natural modifier loci of stem cell differentiation using trans-acting CRISPR/Cas9 editing cassettes. This screen represents a new approach to mutagenesis in plants with potential to reveal cryptic variation in other system. The outcomes of this project will advance our knowledge in a fundamental area of plant genome biology, help uncover and understand the functional architecture of epistasis, and have potential to bring significant improvements to agriculture.",Sebastian Soyk,University of Lausanne,Switzerland,-,802008,ERC-2018-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),LS2 - Integrative Biology: From Genes & Genomes to Systems,2018,43678,45869,1499903,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/802008,University of Lausanne
Horizon 2020,SCIPER,Studying Cancer Individuality by Personal and Predictive Drug Screening and Differential OMICs,"The cellular and molecular systems that determine drug responses in cancer are complex, highly individual, and incompletely understood. As a result, many cancer patients receive ineffective or even harmful therapies, which endangers lives, burdens healthcare systems, and prevents new therapies from reaching clinical approval.To address this problem, we are developing a platform that measures hundreds of ex vivo drug responses from small patient biopsies by immunofluorescence, automated confocal microscopy, single-cell image analysis, and machine learning. We preserve cellular memory and maximize physiological relevance by not culturing or sorting cells prior to drug exposure. Sub-cellular, single-cell, and cell population-wide image analysis reveals on-target drug responses and disentangles multicellular ones. In a first interventional clinical trial, this phenotypic information alone led to strongly improved treatment of patients with aggressive hematologic malignancies.Enabled by this high-throughput, predictive, and phenotypic information, I here propose to identify the molecular and cellular systems that govern treatment response individuality in cancer. (Aim 1) We will combine drug response profiling with RNA sequencing and proteomic measurements of malignant and healthy cells from the same biopsies. Critically, the patient-internal comparisons in both screening and OMICs allow neutralizing complex confounding factors. (Aim 2) New multiplexed immunofluorescence and convolutional neural network-based analyses will identify multiclass cell-types and -states, and quantify non-cell-autonomous responses. (Aim 3) Computational integration and causal inference will identify the molecular determinants and governing principles of drug response individuality in cancer, amenable to further validation.

Horizon 2020,BioMeTRe,Biophysical mechanisms of long-range transcriptional regulation,"In mammals, transcriptional control of many genes relies on cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers, which are often located tens to hundreds of kilobases away from their cognate promoters. Functional interactions between distal regulatory elements and target promoters require mutual physical proximity, which is linked to the three-dimensional structure of the chromatin fiber. Chromosome conformation capture studies revealed that chromosomes are partitioned into Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), sub-megabase domains of preferential physical interactions of the chromatin fiber. Genetic evidence showed that TAD boundaries restrict the genomic range of enhancer-promoter communication, and that interactions between regulatory sequences within TADs are further fine-tuned by smaller-scale structures. However, the mechanistic details of how physical interactions translate into transcriptional outputs are totally unknown. Here we propose to explore the biophysical mechanisms that link chromosome conformation and long-range transcriptional regulation using molecular biology, genetic engineering, single-cell experiments and physical modeling. We will measure chromosomal interactions in single cells and in time using a novel method that relies on an enzymatic process in vivo. Genetic engineering will be used to establish a cell system that allows quantitative measurement of how enhancer-promoter interactions relate to transcription at the population and single-cell levels, and to test the effects of perturbations without confounding effects. Finally, we will develop physical models of promoter operation in the presence of distal enhancers, which will be used to interpret the experimental data and formulate new testable predictions. With this integrated approach we aim at providing an entirely new layer of description of the general principles underlying transcriptional control, which could establish new paradigms for research in epigenetics and gene regulation.",Luca Giorgetti,Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research,Switzerland,-,759366,ERC-2017-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),LS2 - Integrative Biology: From Genes & Genomes to Systems,2017,43101,45291,1500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/759366,Institute Friedrich Miescher
Horizon 2020,ORGANOMICS,Reconstructing human cortex development and malformation with single-cell transcriptomics,"Technologies to sequence single-cell transcriptomes (scRNA-seq) are revolutionizing our ability to analyze cell composition and differentiation in complex tissues. In parallel, recent innovations allow the generation of three-dimensional tissues from stem cells that recapitulate human development. In this proposal, we will focus on human cortex development modelled by cerebral organoids. Our vision is to create an integrative single-cell transcriptomic platform to reconstruct cerebral organoid development, and dissect network alterations that lead to human brain malformations. Our project will be advanced through the following objectives: 1. Single-cell transcriptome-coupled lineage tracing: We will use cellular barcoding to label individual cortical progenitor cells, trace their output and lineage trees with high-throughput scRNA-seq, and quantify lineage transition probabilities between cell types.2. Gene knockout screens in mosaic organoids: We will use CRISPR/Cas9 to perform genetic screens of up to 100 genotypes in mosaic organoids to understand mechanisms that regulate cell lineage decisions during cortex development. 3. High-throughput reconstructions of cortex malformations: We will generate cerebral organoids from patients with cortical malformations and reconstruct networks and infer differentiation hierarchies using high-throughput and lineage-coupled scRNA-seq. We will spatially resolve network aberrations using sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH).ORGANOMICS provides an entirely new quantitative direction to study human corticogenesis. We will build high-resolution models of cortex development by measuring the expression and function of genes in thousands of single cells.

Horizon 2020,NucleolusChromatin,Analysis of the nucleolus in genome organization and function,"In eukaryotic cells, the higher-order organization of genomes is functionally important to ensure correct execution of gene expression programs. For instance, as cells differentiate into specialized cell types, chromosomes undergo diverse structural and organizational changes that affect gene expression and other cellular functions. However, how this process is achieved is still poorly understood. The elucidation of the mechanisms that control the spatial architecture of the genome and its contribution to gene regulation is a key open issue in molecular biology, relevant for physiological and pathological processes. Increasing evidence indicated that large-scale folding of chromatin may affect gene expression by locating genes to specific nuclear subcompartments that are either stimulatory or inhibitory to transcription. Nuclear periphery (NP) and nucleolus are two important nuclear landmarks where repressive chromatin domains are often located. The interaction of chromosomes with NP and nucleolus is thought to contribute to a basal chromosome architecture and genome function. However, while the role of NP in genome organization has been well documented, the function of the nucleolus remains yet elusive. To fully understand how genome organization regulates chromatin and gene expression states, it is necessary to obtain a comprehensive functional map of genome compartmentalization. However, so far, only domains associating with NP (LADs) have been identified and characterized while nucleolar-associated domains (NADs) remained under-investigated. The aim of this project is to fill this gap by developing methods to identify and characterize NADs and analyse the role of the nucleolus in genome organization, moving toward the obtainment of a comprehensive functional map of genome compartmentalization for each cell state and providing novel insights into basic principles of genome organization and its role in gene expression and cell function that yet remain elusive.",Raffaella Santoro,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,787074,ERC-2017-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),LS2 - Integrative Biology: From Genes & Genomes to Systems,2017,43344,45535,2500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/787074,University of Zurich
Horizon 2020,UPRmt,The Mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response,"Mitochondria—organelles specialized in energy harvesting through oxidative phosphorylation (Oxphos)—critically influence metabolism, health and lifespan. Evolved from endosymbiotic proteobacteria, mitochondria retained the vestige of the bacterial genome, the mitochondrial DNA, which encodes 13 subunits of the Oxphos complexes, while the remaining ~80 Oxphos components and the rest of the mitochondrial proteome are encoded on nuclear DNA, translated in the cytoplasm and imported in the mitochondria. The control of the mitochondrial proteome by two genomes exposes these organelles to proteotoxic stress in case of an imbalance between the nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded proteins. Upon such stress, several mitochondrial protein quality control (mtPQC) pathways, including the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), will sense, transmit and re-establish mitochondrial proteostasis through mitonuclear regulatory circuits. Although a robust UPRmt circuit improves health and lifespan in C. elegans, much less is known about mtPQC in vertebrates. We propose here to characterize UPRmt pathways across 3 species by: (1) mapping mammalian UPRmt genes and networks in vivo after the induction of the UPRmt in a large murine genetic reference population at 3 different times throughout life with 2 different inducers; (2) integrating these UPRmt networks with a wide set of clinical, mitochondrial, and molecular phenotypes collected throughout life to establish links between UPRmt mechanisms and health- and lifespan; (3) mechanistically validating the most important UPRmt pathways, using loss-of-function studies in cells, worms and mice; and (4) clinically translating promising UPRmt hits, using genetic association studies in human cohorts. The insight gained will mechanistically define the UPRmt networks from worms to humans and will provide the next step in translating the benefits of activating the UPRmt—initially observed in invertebrates—into targeted human therapies.",Johan Henri Louise Auwerx,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,787702,ERC-2017-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),LS2 - Integrative Biology: From Genes & Genomes to Systems,2017,43405,45382,2500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/787702,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,RNAloc,Epithelial mRNA localization in homeostasis and pathophysiology,"Asymmetric subcellular mRNA distributions have been observed in a variety of polar cell types and organisms. RNA polarization is instrumental at the beginning of life and determines the morphogen gradients needed for embryo patterning. In highly polar neurons, subcellular transcript localization and translation are thought to enhance cellular efficiency and timely responses to extrinsic cues. However, the functional consequence of mRNA localization has, in most cases, not been elucidated. We have shown that a large fraction of an epithelial transcriptome is localized, yet the role(s) of mRNA localization in adult tissue homeostasis and function are unknown. Moreover, we still do not know how the transcript sorting machinery works, and we lack insights into the molecular composition of the membrane-less compartments that may maintain RNA segregation in the cytoplasm.
We will address these gaps by combining RNA microscopy and subcellular proximity proteomics to study the functional contribution of RNA localization in digestive epithelia. Our project will comprehensively map the subcellular space across three adult epithelial tissues – liver, jejunum, and colon. To elucidate the mechanisms that mediate sequence-specific mRNA transport and maintain localization, we will develop a system to tether a construct for proximity proteomics to localized RNAs. We will functionally test the contribution of RNA localization to tissue homeostasis and disease development by disrupting the localizing elements and machinery. 
Our novel toolkit will enable the spatial mapping of RNA and proteins in parallel, allowing us to annotate the subcellular space and subsequently probe the biological significance of this fundamental process in adult epithelia. This novel technology can be extended to the subcellular study of all epithelia and tissues in general; it will ultimately lead to a more comprehensive understanding of tissue function in homeostasis and disease.

Horizon 2020,ZygoticFate,Zygotic Cell Fate and Parent-Biased Gene Expression in Fission Yeast,"As two gametes fuse, the newly formed zygote immediately represses mating, to prevent polyploid formation, and triggers the developmental program that gives rise to a new individual. My work showed that zygotes of fission yeast and higher eukaryotes bare striking similarities, and here I propose to use this powerful model system to explore the basic mechanisms of gamete-to-zygote transition. Working in fission yeast, where gametes and zygotes are well-defined and accessible to outstanding plethora of experimental approaches, will show how different regulatory mechanisms synergize to execute this key cell fate switch.
Our first aim explores zygotic regulation of gene expression and mating blocks. First, to show how zygote-specific signaling propagates, we will identify its targets using biochemical screens. Second, we will analyse how zygotes alter gene expression. High-throughput sequencing will show transcriptional dynamics and genetics approaches will test its regulation and relevance. Third, we will combine microscopy and genetics to reveal the workings of fungal re-fertilization blocks.
Our second aim explores roles and regulation of the parent-biased allele expression in fungal zygotes that I recently discovered. While biochemical and sequencing-based screens will identify genes asymmetrically expressed from parental genomes, genetics strategies will test their roles. A structural biology workpackage will show how a simple homeodomain transcription factor drives the bias between parental genomes.
Similarities between zygotes of fission yeast and higher eukaryotes hint to the relevance of our work for other developmental systems. By understanding fungal blocks to re-fertilization, which have been previously completely overlooked, we may identify their conserved principles, as increasingly evident for other sexual processes.

This is mostly because mechanistic and functional approaches have been limited by the large number of hotspots per nucleus, their small size, and their transient nature. Here, wThere is accumulating evidence for a new gene expression paradigm, in which genes and transcription factors cooperate to create specialized nuclear hotspots optimized for transcription. How hotspots form, and how they impact transcription, however, is unclear. This is mostly because mechanistic and functional approaches have been limited by the large number of hotspots per nucleus, their small size, and their transient nature. Here, we will take advantage of two hotspots that precede all other transcription during zebrafish embryogenesis. The hotspots are large, isolated, and relatively long-lived, and we can interfere with their formation specifically. They therefore provide an excellent opportunity to study nuclear hotspots. The stereotyped activation of transcription during embryogenesis further provides the opportunity to determine the effect of hotspots on gene expression. In Aim 1, we will determine what triggers hotspot formation, identify the components of hotspots and the order in which they come together, and determine the enrichment of components in hotspots compared to nucleoplasm. In Aim 2, we turn our attention to the genes that come together in these hotspots. We will develop a method to visualize single copy genes live and use this to determine how genes come together in transcription hotspots to be activated.

Horizon 2020,SexYeast,Mechanisms of gradient decoding in fission yeast,"How does a cell orient in response to a chemical cue? This basic problem is at the core of how cells interact with their environment. Indeed, the ability to move towards the source of a chemical gradient underlies behaviours as diverse as feeding, identifying a foreign invader or building interconnected cellular networks. Furthermore, chemo-orientation forms the basis of gamete recognition, and is thus critical for genome diversification through sexual reproduction. 

This proposal makes use of one of the simplest eukaryotic models, the fission yeast S.  pombe, to systematically dissect the mechanisms of gradient detection. Gradient sensing occurs during sexual reproduction in a speed-dating process for mate pairing, where dynamic cortical polarity patches secrete pheromones and become stabilized in response to those produced by the other mating type. Chemo-detection depends on a minimal kit of conserved eukaryotic proteins, suggesting that a complete understanding of gradient decoding is possible. We will work towards this goal through four specific aims:

1.	to establish the rules of gradient decoding, using unbiased image analysis and caged pheromones;
2.	to define the architecture of the communication site, by super-resolution and correlative light-electron microscopy;
3.	to probe the molecular regulation of cellular speed-dating, which we hypothesize consists of a spatial decoder and dynamic oscillator;
4.	to reveal natural modifiers of speed-dating for mate selection, by exploiting the diversity of wild strain isolates.

By combining advanced live and correlative imaging with optogenetic, genetic, biochemical and genomic methods, this project will bring a conceptual and molecular understanding to the problem of gradient decoding. Due to the ancient and fundamental nature of gradient orientation, our discoveries will have impact on several fields of research, including those of immunity, wound healing, development, sexual reproduction and evolution.

Horizon 2020,IC-CCD-qHSC,Intrapopulation communication and collective cell decisions of hematopoietic stem cells,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) contribute to blood cell production throughout life and are found at rare, yet tightly regulated frequencies in adult bone marrow (BM). During embryonic and postnatal development, HSCs expand through continuous self-renewing proliferation. Upon entry into adulthood the vast majority of HSCs synchronously convert to a quiescent state. From then on, at any given moment very few HSCs are found in active stages of cell cycle, which suffices to compensate basal HSC loss due to differentiation or cell death. Since proliferation rates of individual HSCs are heterogeneous, entry and exit from cell cycle need to be coordinated at the level of the HSC pool. To date, the mechanisms that orchestrate this collective proliferative behavior and effectively control the maintenance of homeostatic HSC numbers remain unknown. In preliminary work for this project we have customized a pipeline that combines 3D microscopy, deep learning-based image analysis and spatial statistics. Using these tools, we observed that despite showing broad spatial heterogeneity, HSCs tend to cluster and accumulate in relatively large regions of the BM. We now postulate that molecular crosstalk between proximal HSCs enables them to perceive their local densities and triggers collective regulation of HSC function to preserve homeostasis. Through a multidisciplinary approach involving high-level microscopy, spatial analyses, comprehensive metabolomic profiling and single-cell transcriptomics we aim to 1) characterize the basic anatomical and functional features of spatial dependencies between HSCs 2) study the potential role of quorum-sensing mechanisms in HSC crosstalk and 3) investigate if competition for molecular resources in local neighborhoods contributes to maintenance of HSC homeostasis.

Horizon 2020,DiRECT,Directly reprogrammed renal cells for targeted medicine,"The global incidence of kidney disease is on the rise, but little progress has been made to develop novel therapies or preventative measures.New methods to generated renal tissue in vitro hold great promise for regenerative medicine and the prospect of organ replacement. Most of the strategies employed differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into kidney organoids, which can be derived from patient tissue. Direct reprogramming is an alternative approach to convert one cell type into another using cell fate specifying transcription factors. We were the first to develop a method to directly reprogram mouse and human fibroblasts to kidney cells (induced renal tubular epithelial cells - iRECs) without the need for pluripotent cells. Morphological, transcriptomic and functional analyses found that directly reprogrammed iRECs are remarkably similar to native renal tubular cells. Direct reprogramming is fast, technically simple and scalable.This proposal aims to establish direct reprogramming in nephrology and develop novel in vitro models for kidney diseases that primarily affect the renal tubules. We will unravel the mechanics of how only four transcription factors can change the morphology and function of fibroblasts towards a renal tubule cell identity. These insights will be used to identify alternative routes to directly reprogram tubule cells with increased efficiency and accuracy. We will identify cell type specifying factors for reprogramming of tubular segment specific cell types.

Horizon 2020,MCS-MD,The Molecular Dynamics of Membrane Contact Sites,"The goal of this project is to obtain an atomistic structural and dynamical characterization of the inner workings of membrane contact sites (MCS) between intracellular organelles, in order to understand how molecular processes such as non-vesicular lipid transport at MCS might modulate lipid homeostatic processes at the whole-cell scale.Investigation of the mechanisms taking place at MCS has emerged as a central topic in cellular biology in the last few years, and it has led to a large amount of novel cellular, biochemical and structural data that has drastically revolutionized our general understanding of lipid homeostasis in the cell. Yet, due to limitations of experimental methods, a high-resolution understanding of how MCS proteins work is still limited, and the specific molecular details of these mechanisms are still under intense debate, and especially concerning the specificity of lipid transport or the discrimination between lipid sensing and lipid transport.To understand these processes with unprecedented molecular detail, I will develop high-throughput protocols based on atomistic and coarse-grain molecular dynamics simulations that leverage and take advantage of all the available, yet often scattered, experimental data.  With these approaches, that have not been used so far to investigate MCS because of the extreme complexity of these cellular machineries, I will obtain a detailed understanding of key molecular processes taking place at MCS, including the specificity of membrane binding, the mechanism of lipid uptake and release, the influence of confinement on protein activity, and the role of membrane lipid composition in the regulation of lipid transport.This approach will drive forward our perception of the limits of structure-based in-silico methods, and it will contribute to our mechanistic understanding of key cellular biology processes by providing new quantitative results that are beyond the current possibilities of experimental approaches.",Stefano Vanni,University of Fribourg,Switzerland,-,803952,ERC-2018-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS3 - Cellular, Developmental & Regenerative Biology",2018,43617,45657,1497719,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/803952,University of Fribourg

A fundamental question in cellular and developmental biology has been how the lineage and trajectory of a cell lead to its specification and differentiation. Remarkable progress in genome editing and single-cell sequencing has generated the opportunity to understand this process at global scales and single-cell resolution. We have recently developed methods to reconstruct the cellular ancestry and transcriptional trajectories of cells during embryogenesis. The resulting lineage and trajectory trees can be analyzed to gain comprehensive views of how cellular diversity arises and how differentiation leads to physiologically specialized cell types. To generate such global views of cellular development, we will:  1. Define the cellular diversity and gene expression trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis and organogenesis. Trajectory trees will be generated from scRNA-seq data and analyzed to reconstruct the gene expression pathways underlying fate specification.  2. Reveal the relationships between lineage and transcriptional trajectories during fate specification.

Discover the gene expression cascades that remodel cells into physiologically functional types. Cell biological modules will be identified by comparing gene enrichment in differentiation trajectories and reveal the specialized and shared mechanisms of differentiation.

Horizon 2020,CENGIN,Deciphering and engineering centriole assembly,"Deciphering and engineering the assembly of cellular organelles is a key pursuit in biology. The centriole is an evolutionarily conserved organelle well suited for this goal, and which is crucial for cell signaling, motility and division. The centriole exhibits a striking 9-fold radial symmetry of microtubules around a likewise symmetrical cartwheel containing stacked ring-bearing structures. Components essential for generating this remarkable architecture from alga to man have been identified. A next critical step is to engineer assays to probe the dynamics of centriole assembly with molecular precision to fully understand how these components together build a functional organelle. Our ambitious research proposal aims at taking groundbreaking steps in this direction through four specific aims:

We will also use HS-AFM to analyze monobodies against SAS-6, as well as engineer surfaces and DNA origamis to further dissect ring assembly.   
2) Deciphering ring stacking mechanisms. We will use cryo-ET to identify SAS-6 features that direct stacking of ring structures and set cartwheel height. Moreover, we will develop an HS-AFM stacking assay and a reconstituted stacking assay from human cells. 
3) Understanding peripheral element contributions to centriole biogenesis. We will dissect the function of the peripheral centriole pinhead protein Cep135/Bld10p, as well as identify and likewise dissect peripheral A-C linker proteins.

Horizon 2020,SymBreakOrganoid,Cell-to-cell variability during symmetry breaking in organoid development,"Cell-to-cell variability is an inherent property of populations of cells. As a starting point for symmetry breaking events, it is also an essential building block for self-organised pattern forming systems. Nonetheless, the sources and roles of cell-to-cell variability in symmetry-breaking events during collective cell behavior await a quantitative and mechanistic understanding. To obtain these insights, we will use a model system of intestinal organoids, which recapitulates most of the processes of morphogenesis and patterning observed in intestinal tissue. In this system, the symmetry-breaking event is observed when, despite all single cells in a growing organoid are exposed to uniform environments, only a fraction of cells acquires specific cell fates, generating asymmetric structures such as crypts and villi. This project aims to uncover the extent, sources, and consequences of cell heterogeneity. To this end, we will use advanced multiplexed imaging of intestinal stem cells in 3D organoid development to monitor quantitatively the behaviour of each single cell in the system. Initially, we will identify potential sources of cell-to-cell variability, such as the microenvironment or the cell cycle. Next, we will create models to identify predictors of symmetry breaking and patterning. In parallel, we will determine the extent of cellular heterogeneity by single-cell RNA sequencing during organoid formation. Finally, we will test if cellular heterogeneity is necessary and sufficient to induce symmetry-breaking of intestinal organoids by experimentally inducing and perturbing cell-to-cell variability. Thus, this research proposal will address a major question in developmental biology and collective cell behavior, namely how single cells exposed to a uniform growth-promoting environment generate asymmetric structures. Moreover, it will unravel how local interactions between single cells give rise to emergent, self-organized patterns. ",Prisca Liberali,Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research,Switzerland,-,758617,ERC-2017-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS3 - Cellular, Developmental & Regenerative Biology",2017,43374,45199,1500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/758617,Institute Friedrich Miescher
Horizon 2020,INPHORS,"Intracellular phosphate reception and signaling: A novel homeostatic system with roles for an orphan organelle?
","Cells face a phosphate challenge. Growth requires a minimal concentration of this limiting resource because intracellular phosphate (Pi) is a compound of nucleic acids and modifies most cellular proteins. At the same time, cytosolic Pi may not rise much, because elevated cytosolic Pi can stall metabolism. It reduces the free energy that nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis can provide to drive energetically unfavorable reactions. I will undertake a pioneering study to elucidate how cells strike this critical balance. We will identify a novel pathway for intracellular phosphate reception and signaling (INPHORS) and explore the role of acidocalcisomes in it. These studies may identify a key function of these very poorly understood organelles, provide one reason for their evolutionary conservation and elucidate a novel homeostatic system of critical importance for cellular metabolism. We recently provided first hints that a dedicated pathway for sensing and signaling intracellular Pi might exist, which regulates multiple systems for import, export and acidocalcisomal storage of Pi, such that cytosolic Pi homeostasis is guaranteed 1. Yeast cells will serve as an powerful model system for exploring this pathway and its physiological relevance. Yeast Pi transport and storage proteins are known. Furthermore, we can establish cell-free in vitro systems that reconstitute Pi-regulated transport and storage processes, providing an excellent basis for identifying signaling complexes and studying their dynamics. We will (A) generate novel tools to uncouple, individually manipulate and measure key parameters for the INPHORS pathway; (B) identify its components, study their interactions and regulation; (C) elucidate how acidocalcisomes are targeted by INPHORS and how they contribute to Pi homeostasis; (D) study the crosstalk between INPHORS and Pi-regulated transcriptional responses; (E) test the relevance of INPHORS for Pi homeostasis in mammalian cells.",Andreas Mayer,University of Lausanne,Switzerland,-,788442,ERC-2017-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS3 - Cellular, Developmental & Regenerative Biology",2017,43344,45535,2499998,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/788442,University of Lausanne
Horizon 2020,EnviroTag,Unbiased niche identification and manipulation in stem cells and cancer,"For the longest time, researchers assumed that stemness is a cell-intrinsic feature. However, recently my work and the work of others have shown that specific microenvironments can restore stem cell identity in differentiated epithelial cells or induce transitions from one mature cell type to another. This instructive capacity of niches is equally important in homeostasis and disease. Like stem cells, cancer cells only survive in particular environments that nurture and protect them. This is particularly evident in the process of metastasis where only 1 out of 10 000 circulating tumor cells will find a suitable niche to grow. Nevertheless, our understanding of stem cell and cancer niches is still very limited. The main reason for this knowledge gap is the lack of suitable analysis tools.

In the course of the EnviroTag project my team and I will generate a novel type of in vivo reporter system, which can label and genetically engineer the cellular environment of any cell of interest. We will use a multidisciplinary approach that combines the EnviroTag system with single cell sequencing, 3D-reconstructed confocal microscopy and organoid technology to study the dynamic roles of niche composition during tissue regeneration and cancer progression. Focusing on the gastro-intestinal tract, we will investigate how changes in the stem or cancer cell microenvironment control success and failure during tissue repair and the earliest steps of metastasis. Thereby, we will generate a new understanding of microenvironmental dynamics and uncover new regulatory mechanisms, signals and cell types that can be targeted to stimulate tissue regeneration or prevent metastatic spread.

Objectives:

1) Establish a spatial in vivo reporter system for microenvironmental labelling and manipulation 
2) Map functional interactions of stem cells and their niches during homeostasis and active regeneration
3) Identify the minimal niche requirements for metastatic engraftment and proliferation",Helmuth Gehart,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,949781,ERC-2020-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS4 - Physiology in Health, Disease & Ageing",2020,44256,46265,1809318,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/949781,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,TUMOR-LOCK,Tumor-lock: forbid the generation of circulating tumor cells,"One woman in eight is destined to develop breast cancer. All women that lose their battle against breast cancer vividly realize that its most deadly feature is not the primary lesion, but its ability to spread to distant sites and become an incurable, metastatic disease. In this proposal, we aim to address what is arguably the most ambitious challenge in the cancer field: metastasis prevention.

	Metastatic spread of cancer occurs through the generation and hematogenous dissemination of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). We recently discovered that CTCs are heterogeneous, and that CTC clusters – multicellular aggregates of cancer cells and immune cells in circulation – represent the most powerful mediators of disease spread (Szczerba et al., Nature, 2019; Gkountela et al., Cell, 2019). Post-intravasation biological and clinical features of CTCs are extensively interrogated, yet, surprisingly, the mechanisms that dictate their generation from a solid tumor lesion are unknown. Only a minimal fraction of cancer cells is capable to intravasate in functional blood vessels, while the vast majority of tumor cells will always remain in situ. Understanding the fundamental biological principles that govern CTC generation is of paramount importance, as it could lead to the development of new therapeutic agents that lock tumor cells in their primary site, thereby preventing metastasis.

	Our preliminary data strongly suggest that CTC generation is not occurring in a stochastic fashion, but it is dictated by very precise and previously-unappreciated signals. Based on these very exciting findings, the two predominant goals of this proposal are: first, to gain insights into those fundamental cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms that govern CTC intravasation in vivo. Second, to identify actionable targets and direct treatment opportunities to lock tumor cells in situ and blunt CTC generation, with the long-term ambition to prevent the metastatic spread of breast cancer.",Nicola Aceto,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,101001652,ERC-2020-COG,Consolidator Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS4 - Physiology in Health, Disease & Ageing",2020,44348,46173,1999995,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101001652,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,GutHormones,Understanding the Biology of Human Enteroendocrine Cells,"Intestinal epithelium consists of self-renewing crypt-villus units and contains 6 mature cell types: Enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, Tuft cells, M cells and Enteroendocrine cells (EECs). The rare EECs are subclassified by the (>20) hormones they produce. Generally, EECs sense intestinal content and regulate gastrointestinal activity, systemic metabolism and food intake. While one EEC hormone, GLP1, has been developed into a highly successful diabetes drug, a paucity of laboratory models has complicated human EEC studies. 
Previously, we identified adult crypt stem cells by the novel marker Lgr5, and established conditions to grow ‘gut organoids’ from these. By single cell RNA sequencing, we have resolved the complex EEC subtype hierarchy into 5 lineages. Our studies underscore significant differences between mouse and man, not unexpected given the divergent diets and metabolism. Gut organoids can be manipulated to contain all EEC lineages. We have created a set of human organoids in which the individual hormones are fluorescently tagged by CRISPR. 
The current proposal exploits the technologies described above, as well as our ‘Human EEC Atlas’ to generate a detailed picture of the biology of EECs, their triggers, their interconnectivity and their products. To this end, I propose to:
1.	Complete the Human EEC Atlas and hormone-tagged organoid set for stomach and colon. 
2.	Resolve how individual EEC subtype fates are set. 
3.	Resolve which luminal receptors and ligands allow sensing of nutrient components and microbial products
4.	Resolve cross-regulation of EEC subtypes.
5.	Investigate systemic effects of novel EEC products in mouse knockout models.
Successful completion of this proposal will generate a comprehensive characterisation of EECs. This will inspire new therapeutic approaches to reshape the EEC landscape for treatment of metabolic diseases (obesity, diabetes, fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis) and other consequences of the Western-type diet.",Johannes Clevers,Roche,Switzerland,-,101020405,ERC-2020-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS4 - Physiology in Health, Disease & Ageing",2020,44470,46295,2733150,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101020405,Roche
Horizon 2020,HumanPlacenta,Human Placental Development  and the Uterine Microenvironment,"How does the human placenta develop and how is this influenced by the maternal uterine microenvironment? These are the central questions addressed in my proposal. Normal growth and development of the fetus depends on the placenta, the extra-embryonic organ derived from trophectoderm. Successful pregnancy depends on the earliest stages of development when placental extravillous trophoblast cells (EVT) infiltrate the uterine mucosa, the decidua. EVT invade the decidua to transform the uterine spiral arteries into a dilated vessel capable of high conductance. Deficient arterial remodelling by EVT results in miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction and stillbirth. However, excessive invasion into the uterine wall is also potentially dangerous. Thus, to achieve a successful pregnancy, a territorial boundary is drawn with a balance between fetal EVT invasion and maternal decidual cells.  Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these maternal/fetal interactions has been challenging due both to practical and ethical limitations and lack of reliable in vitro models. I have recently derived 3D culture systems (organoids) from human decidua and placenta that will provide the essential tools. I will use these organoids combined with single cell genomics, Crispr/Cas9 genome editing and tissue engineering to study: (i) the molecular mechanisms that specify the EVT lineage (ii) the role of paracrine signalling from maternal decidual glands in regulating placental development  (iii) cell-cell interactions between decidua and EVT by creating an artificial model of decidua made from tailored collagen scaffolds seeded with stromal, glandular and immune cells. My proposal capitalises on the remarkable ability of organoid cultures to faithfully model human physiology.

Horizon 2020,Merlin,MEtabolic Cell Reprogramming for the Recovery of Lost INsulin-Producing Cells,"My group aims at fostering the regeneration of insulin-producing β-cells in the diabetic pancreas by promoting the reprogramming of other islet endocrine “non-β” cells. I will use mice and human islets to trigger the metabolic reprogramming of: i) peripheral organs, in order to reduce hyperglycemia, and ii) human islet non-β-cells, to induce their acquisition of insulin secretion.
I developed transgenics to elicit total (>99%) or graded (5-90%) β-cell loss. These mice revealed that non-β-cells, which produce other hormones, can naturally switch to insulin production upon β-cell loss, and lead to diabetes recovery. My group recently showed that human non-β-cells, from healthy or diabetic donors, also display plasticity and can engage in regulated insulin secretion. 
What metabolic adaptations occur in peripheral organs in response to insulin deficiency, but without complications? Can metabolic reprogramming of peripheral organs, based on these adaptations, suffice to control glycemia? Can metabolic reprogramming change the identity of a cell? 
Natural recovery of euglycemia after β-cell loss is documented in mice. To know the mechanisms driving relief, my lab will characterize islet cell dynamics and circulating molecules (metabolites, RNA, peptides) after various degrees of β-cell loss. We will perform a full analysis of blood and peripheral organs in recovered mice, and an array of genetic and pharmacological experiments modulating BAT mass and function to test its role in taming hyperglycemia.
We will explore and define the metabolic differences between human β- and non-β-cells. Using monotypic “pseudoislets” we will do RNAseq, proteomics and metabolomics after exposure to glucose. We will quantify oxygen consumption, extracellular acidification and ATP production in response to nutrients and metabolic toxins.

Horizon 2020,BRITE,Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying brite adipocyte specification and activation,"Brown adipocytes can dissipate energy in a process called adaptive thermogenesis. Whilst the classical brown adipose tissue (BAT) depots disappear during early life in humans, cold exposure can promote the appearance of brown-like adipocytes within the white adipose tissue (WAT), termed brite (brown-in-white). Increased BAT activity results in increased energy expenditure and has been correlated with leanness in humans. Hence, recruitment of brite adipocytes may constitute a promising therapeutic strategy to treat obesity and its associated metabolic diseases. Despite the beneficial metabolic properties of brown and brite adipocytes, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying their specification and activation in vivo. This proposal focuses on understanding the complex biology of thermogenic adipocyte biology by studying the epigenetic and transcriptional aspects of WAT britening and BAT recruitment in vivo to identify pathways of therapeutic relevance and to better define the brite precursor cells. Specific aims are to 1) investigate epigenetic and transcriptional states and heterogeneity in human and mouse adipose tissue; 2) develop a novel time-resolved method to correlate preceding chromatin states and cell fate decisions during adipose tissue remodelling; 3) identify and validate key (drugable) epigenetic and transcriptional regulators involved in brite adipocyte specification. Experimentally, I will use adipose tissue samples from human donors and mouse models, to asses at the single-cell level cellular heterogeneity, transcriptional and epigenetic states, to identify subpopulations, and to define the adaptive responses to cold or β-adrenergic stimulation.

Horizon 2020,Healthybiota,"Microbiota-host interactions for integrative metabolic health reprogramming
","Obesity is a metabolic disorder leading to various health risks and reduced life expectancy. Insulin resistance is a major obesity related disorder, and a main cause for the onset of type 2 diabetes. During cold exposure or caloric restriction (CR), brown adipocytes emerge within the white fat (known as “beige” cells). This process, referred to as fat browning, increases the metabolic capacity of the adipose tissues to combust energy and is seen as promising anti-obesity and anti-diabetic strategy. The intestinal microbiota co-develops with the host; microbiota depletion, or cold-induced shift of its composition are sufficient to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, in part mediated by the innate immune system-mediated fat browning. The microbial signals and composition, critical for our understanding of the microbiota-host mutualism and metabolic improvements during cold and CR, remain unclear. By integrating expertise from several areas including physiology, bioinformatics, immunology, microbiology and developmental biology; and by developing computational approaches for comparing the metagenomics, metabolomics and transcriptomics data from the CR- and the cold-exposed mice with cohorts of human subjects, we will establish the microbiota role in orchestrating the CR-induced metabolic improvements and innate immune response, and provide mechanistic explanations on the microbiota-host mutualism during CR and cold. Finally, by using lineage-tracing studies and developing transgenic mouse models, we will determine the importance of the beige fat in the CR-induced beneficial effects on the host, and the importance of the microbiota in mediating this process. Manipulating the gut microbiota and exploiting the mechanistic links revealed by this study would be of conceptual importance for our understanding of microbiota-host mutualism in the metabolic homeostasis, and could lead to development of novel therapeutics for improving metabolic health.",Mirko Trajkovski,University of Geneva,Switzerland,-,815962,ERC-2018-COG,Consolidator Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS4 - Physiology in Health, Disease & Ageing",2018,43617,45443,1999999,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/815962,University of Geneva
Horizon 2020,TransReg,Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of cardiac regenerative capacity in the zebrafish,"While myocardial infarction leads to adverse ventricular remodeling ultimately causing heart failure in humans, some animals, including zebrafish can regenerate the injured heart. We recently revealed a high degree of plasticity in cardiomyocyte subpopulations involved in the reconstruction of the injured heart. The gene regulatory network involved in heart regeneration is starting to be elucidated and epigenetic remodeling has been suggested to play a pivotal role during this process. Similarly it is known that the environment can influence the regenerative capacity but whether such an effect can be transmitted from one generation to the next has not been addressed. This mechanism is called transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) and describes the transfer of experiences from parents to their offspring through the gametes, independent on changes in DNA sequence. TEI has also been described in humans: starvation suffered by grandparents affects the metabolism of grandchildren. TEI is also relevant to organ injury: in rats, offspring from parents exposed to liver toxicants revealed reduced hepatic fibrosis in response to the same injury. Changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs have been associated to TEI. We aim to describe for the first time epigenetic inheritance of organ regeneration and unravel its underlying mechanism using the zebrafish model. We will assess whether cardiac injury elicits epigenetic modifications in sperm and determine if offspring from injured parental fish reveal altered heart regeneration. Genetic models will be developed for functional assessment of identified modifications. We will also further analyze cell plasticity during heart regeneration and address whether hearts regenerated from different progenitors respond equally well to further injuries.

Horizon 2020,TRANSREG,"Dissecting the role of Translational Regulation in Tumorigenesis
","The control of translation is a key determinant of protein abundance, which in turn defines cellular states. The impact of translational regulation may be even greater during the transition from homeostasis to malignancy, as revealed by the surprisingly low correlations between mRNA and protein levels in human cancer databases. This raises the intriguing possibility that through an ability to generate aberrant downstream networks of translational regulators, oncogenic drivers might impose altered protein synthesis programs that become the driving force for tumor formation and malignant progression. We recently unveiled a hitherto unappreciated role for upstream open reading frame (uORF) translation in tumorigenesis and unearthed a novel switch from conventional EIF2 initiation factor-mediated to alternative EIF2A-mediated uORF translation. These observations suggest that uORFs constitute an exciting new frontier in the field of translational regulation with the potential to fundamentally impact cellular fate. Here, I propose to systematically analyze the function of uORFs during tumorigenesis. First, we will conduct an in vivo CRISPR/CAS9-based screen in mice to elucidate the role of thousands of uORFs in development, differentiation and upon oncogenic transformation. Second, focusing on select uORFs surfacing in the screen, we will document their role during tumor initiation and progression. Third, we will develop novel tools to detect uORF translation in vivo, exploit them to monitor uORF translation during different stages of tumorigenesis, gain mechanistic insight into their function and finally test the relevance of these findings in human cancer. Collectively, these approaches will provide unprecedented and comprehensive insight into the function of uORFs, unravel new paradigms in the control of gene expression and expose novel strategies for cancer diagnostics and treatment.",Ataman Sendöl,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,759006,ERC-2017-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS4 - Physiology in Health, Disease & Ageing",2017,43313,45961,1977148,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/759006,University of Zurich
Horizon 2020,DstablizeMemory,Neural circuit mechanisms of memory destabilization,"Memories can be rendered rewritable through a phenomenon called reconsolidation. The all-limiting step in this memory re-evaluation process is its initiation; the retrieval-dependent destabilization of the memory. However, the understanding of how a stable memory can be switched into a vulnerable but modifiable state is mostly in its infancy. Therefore, I aim to investigate the neural circuit mechanisms underlying retrieval-induced memory destabilization in the tractable fruit fly brain. 

A prerequisite to investigate the neural mechanisms involved in destabilizing a memory is to know where the learned information is stored and to have access to the associated network. Olfactory memories in flies are stored in the mushroom body as changes between odor coding principle cells and valence coding output neurons. The cell specific genetic access to the 2500 neurons of each mushroom body allows to manipulate and monitor the activity of all components of the network in behaving animals. Recently I established a paradigm that allows to study the mechanisms underlying memory reconsolidation in this numerically simple brain structure. First results indicate that I have identified specific neurons which are crucial for destabilizing reward memory. Starting from these findings I will study the neural circuit mechanisms involved in memory destabilization. 

I aim to generate an understanding of
1)	the neural circuits underlying memory destabilization 
2)	how restrictive conditions gate reconsolidation
3)	the role of targeted protein degradation in the destabilization of memory

The work will establish the first mechanistic insight into how memories are destabilized, how a destabilized memory is represented in the brain and how boundary conditions prevent the initiation of memory reconsolidation.

Horizon 2020,TANGO,Tanycyte/arcuate Neuron communications in the regulation of energy balance,"The escalating pandemic of obesity and type-2 diabetes represents one of the most pressing and costly biomedical challenges confronting modern society. The brain's impaired ability to sense and respond to variations in energy homeostasis is increasingly recognized as playing a role in the pathophysiology of these disorders. By sensing the nutritional status of the organism, distinct neural cell populations –including neurons and glia present in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH)– tightly regulate energy balance. In the last decade, it has become clear that tanycytes –hypothalamic glial cells lining the bottom of the third ventricle and sending a single basal process into the ARH– are also able to detect variations of nutrient and hormone levels. Henceforth described as “sensors” of the metabolic state, tanycytes would then modulate neuronal function in order to regulate energy balance. However, the mechanisms underlying the communication between tanycytes and ARH neurons in the context of metabolism remain largely unexamined.

The overall objective of this project is to elucidate the molecular, structural and functional organization of tanycyte/ARH neuron communications, and their involvement in the regulation of energy balance. A multidisciplinary approach including neuroanatomy, molecular biology, and physiology will be implemented to achieve four specific aims: 
1)	To decipher the genetic and neuroanatomical features of tanycyte/ARH neuron metabolic units
2)	To ascertain the impact of tanycyte Annexin A1 on ARH neuronal function
3)	To uncover the role of tanycyte local translation in specific tanycyte/neuron communications

Horizon 2020,InterAct,Shaping Body Movements through Interactions with Brainstem Neurons,"Understanding how neuronal circuits regulate the enormous repertoire of movements is a key outstanding question in neuroscience. Neurons contributing to execution and learning of body movements are distributed throughout the nervous system. Control of body movements entails the engagement of connected brain motor centers to generate action commands, providing instructions for execution to the spinal cord. The brainstem as  focus of this proposal represents an essential intermediary between upper planning and spinal executive motor circuits. Recent technological advances have led to the identification of brainstem neurons regulating diverse forms of body movement, including locomotion and skilled forelimb movements, both engaging limbs but for very distinct purposes. The goal of this project is to understand how brainstem populations involved in specific body movements are endowed with their behavior-specific fingerprints through interactions within the broader motor system. We aim to determine how key synaptic inputs to specific brainstem neurons shape their activity patterns in synchrony with the regulated behavior. We hypothesize that the emergence of action-specific neuronal ensembles in the brainstem requires control by their driver, gating and modulatory elements, with the function to promote the recruitment of specific brainstem neurons during desired actions and to suppress them when no or alternative actions are planned. We build on our know-how on brainstem neurons and use sophisticated combinatorial viral-genetic targeting strategies, state of the art neuronal recording and activity-pattern modifying technologies, combined with precise quantitative behavioral readouts in mice to address this question. Together, our project will elucidate circuit mechanisms by which brainstem neurons interact in the motor system to control the generation of body movements, thereby uncovering principles of how the nervous system generates diverse actions.",Silvia Arber,Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research,Switzerland,-,101018151,ERC-2020-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),LS5 - Neuroscience & Disorders of the Nervous Systems,2020,44743,46568,2427500,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101018151,Institute Friedrich Miescher
Horizon 2020,INFANT MEMORIES,Dissecting hippocampal circuits  for the encoding of early-life memories,"The infant brain is a formidable learning machine. But is it able to encode memories of early-life experiences? Since most of us don’t remember what happened during the first years of our lives, for a long time this question has been open to debate. Recent evidence suggests that, even if we cannot recall them, early-life memories are encoded in the developing hippocampus, persist in a silent state into adulthood, and can affect the acquisition of new information later in life. We know very little about how the infant brain encodes early-life memories, despite the fact that our earliest experiences can stick with us and influence our behaviour as adults. How can the infant hippocampus produce long-lasting memory traces when its circuits are not yet mature? Why can’t we remember early-life memories? And how can infant memories have long-lasting effects if we can’t recall them? To answer these questions, in the following project I propose to study memory processes in the developing brain using the mouse as a model organism. I will implement a combination of genetics, viral tagging, calcium imaging, and opto- and chemogenetic methodologies, in association with behavioural paradigms, to track in vivo the activity of a large number of neurons as the brain matures, and to gain fundamental insights into the early functions of the mammalian memory system. The aims of my proposal are: 1. to understand how the infant hippocampus produces neuronal ensembles to represent early-life experiences; 2. to identify and dissect the neural circuits encoding infant memories; and 3. to unravel how neurons supporting silent memories created during infancy influence learning processes in adults.

Horizon 2020,CELPRED,Circuit elements of the cortical circuit for predictive processing,"One promising theoretical framework to explain the function of cortex is predictive processing. It postulates that cortex functions by maintaining an internal model, or internal representation, of the world through a comparison of predictions based on this internal model with incoming sensory information. Implementing predictive processing in a cortical circuit would require a set of distinct functional cell types. These would include neurons that compute a difference between top-down predictions and bottom-up input, referred to as prediction error neurons, and a separate population of neurons that integrate the output of prediction error neurons to maintain an internal representation of the world. This research proposal will test the framework of predictive processing and identify different putative circuit elements and cell types that are thought to form the circuit in mouse visual cortex. We will use a combination of physiological recordings, optogenetic manipulations of neural activity, and gene expression measurements to determine the cell types that have functional responses consistent with different prediction errors, as well as those coding for the internal representation. Identifying the circuit elements underlying predictive processing in cortex may reveal a strategy to bias processing either towards top-down or bottom-up drive when the balance between the two is perturbed, as may be the case in neuropsychiatric disorders.

Horizon 2020,SocialNAc,Circuit and synaptic plasticity mechanisms of approach and avoidance social behavior.,"Social behavior is defined as any modality of communication and interaction between two or more conspecifics. These behaviors, which include affiliative and antagonistic interactions, are exhibited by all sexually reproducing species, they are characterized by high-level complexity of communication through multiple sensory modalities and they are essential for survival. Humans and other animals living in groups continuously experience situations in which they need to select appropriate behavioral responses upon exposure to conspecifics. At the very basis of this social behavior, an individual needs to decide for example whether to approach (positive or appetitive) or avoid (negative or aversive) other individuals. Here, using mice, we will investigate the brain circuits and synaptic mechanisms involved in conspecific approach and avoidance behavior. The Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) is a key region of the mesocorticolimbic circuits for evaluating appetitive and aversive information. Recent studies have revealed the importance of NAc in social behavior, but which neurons within this structure are relevant and how they contribute to conspecific interaction is largely unknown. We hypothesize that different populations of neurons within the NAc orchestrate and integrate different types of socially relevant information to initiate the appropriate behavioral response. Using in vivo and ex vivo recordings and circuit-specific optogenetic manipulations in specific social interaction conditions, we will investigate how the NAc integrates information about conspecifics and how it incorporates learned associations to initiate conspecific approach or avoidance.  This study will thus identify and functionally characterize the circuit and synaptic mechanisms controlling socially appetitive and aversive stimuli, and hence pave the way for a causal understanding of the processes underlying disruption of complex social behaviors in psychiatric disorders.",Camilla Bellone,University of Geneva,Switzerland,-,864552,ERC-2019-COG,Consolidator Grants,Life Sciences (LS),LS5 - Neuroscience & Disorders of the Nervous Systems,2019,43983,45808,1996424,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/864552,University of Geneva
Horizon 2020,F-Addict,Convergence of positive and negative reinforcement in fentanyl addiction,"F-Addict strives to unravel the neural circuits driving compulsion in fentanyl addiction. We ask the question how fentanyl causes fast transition from medical or recreational controlled drug use to compulsive consumption.

The neural correlate of this difference remains elusive. We posit that repetitive withdrawal leads to strong negative reinforcement, which in conjunction with inherent positive reinforcement favors the transition to compulsion. F-Addict will uncover the synaptic processes and neuronal population activity leading to addiction in a mouse model of oral fentanyl self-administration. Much preliminary data implicate activity in the mesolimbic dopamine system and upstream subcortical regions (paraventricular thalamus/habenula/basolateral amygdala) in positive and negative reinforcement, respectively. In addition, top down control, in particular by the orbitofrontal cortex may drive compulsive drug use. The proposed project will harness advanced circuit investigations for an innovative, original perspective: how does positive and negative reinforcement in fentanyl addiction contrast with current circuit models of addiction that are based on psychostimulants? In a translational spirit, F-Addict will also examine the effects of oral substitution with methadone and buprenorphine, recognized therapies for opioid addiction. Much preliminary data provides proof of feasibility and principle. We are confident that our approach at the frontiers of modern neurosciences carries the potential for groundbreaking results to answer a timely question. Unraveling the neural basis of fentanyl addiction will enhance the molecular understanding of circuit modulation to shape future therapies facing the still growing opioid epidemic.

Horizon 2020,HURET,"The human retina at single cell resolution: functional architecture, disease mechanism and therapy development","Vision is of key importance for humans and losing vision has a major effect on day-to-day life. Vision starts in the retina, where an image captured by photoreceptors is processed by retinal circuits built from more than hundred cell types. Information flows from the retina via the thalamus to a number of cortical areas. Despite the large number of cortical neurons involved in vision, most blinding diseases originate in the retina and are cell-type specific. Although the vertebrate retina has a conserved cellular architecture, only a few animal models of visual diseases reproduce the pathology found in humans. Therefore, there is a major need for understanding the healthy and the disease-affected human retina. Recently my laboratory developed a set of new technologies that enable us to study the human retina, to understand its functional architecture and disease mechanism in its cell types, and so to develop therapies. Using these technologies, we first aim to describe the functional diversity as well as the function of ganglion cell types and their circuits in the human retina. Second, we aim to reveal mechanisms of cell-type vulnerability in human and mouse retinas. Third, we aim to provide proof of principle for cell type-targeted near infrared vision restoration in the human retina. Taken together, this study will provide insights into the structure, function, and mechanisms of disease of the cell types in the human visual system and will investigate a new approach to restore vision in patients with blinding diseases.",Botond Roska,Institute of Molecular and Clinical Ophthalmology Basel,Switzerland,-,883781,ERC-2019-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),LS5 - Neuroscience & Disorders of the Nervous Systems,2019,44136,45961,2500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/883781,Institute of Molecular and Clinical Ophthalmology Basel
Horizon 2020,NATURE_NURTURE,Intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of neuronal identity,"Neuronal diversity determines the variety of circuits that can be formed and thus sets the framework for an animal’s behavioural repertoire. During development, distinct neuronal types emerge from interactions between cell-intrinsic processes and cell-extrinsic processes. In the brain, untangling how intrinsic and extrinsic processes contribute to neuronal identity has been difficult, as neurons are highly interconnected and heterogeneous cells with distinct and dynamic sensitivities to environmental signals. In such conditions, high temporal single-cell resolution approaches are required to parse out the drivers of cell-type differentiation.
The mouse neocortex is an ideal model to tease out drivers of differentiation: radially, cell-intrinsic genetic mechanisms drive the generation of successive neuron types across cortical layers; tangentially, cell-extrinsic processes are critical to drive differentiation via synaptic input across cortical areas. Here, using the developing neocortex as a model system, I propose to identify how cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic processes interact to define distinct neuron identities by characterizing:
1. emergence of area-specific neuronal and progenitor identities using FlashTag fate mapping and single-cell RNA sequencing (Work Package (WP) 1)
2. plasticity of area-specific neuronal states in response to genetic manipulation, transplantation or input/activity manipulation (WP2)
3. spatial context-independent components of neuron identity, by uncovering core molecular and circuit states in vitro (WP3)
4. postnatal experience-dependent controls over neuronal identity, using the precocial rodent Acomys as a new model to study the role of early brain-world interactions (WP4).
Together, these experiments aim to identify the molecular determinants of progenitor and neuron types by distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of cell identity, with the long-term aim of reverse-engineering tailored neuronal cell-types for circuit repair.",Denis Jabaudon,University of Geneva,Switzerland,-,883855,ERC-2019-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),LS5 - Neuroscience & Disorders of the Nervous Systems,2019,44075,46265,2499936,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/883855,University of Geneva
Horizon 2020,REMIND,Targeting pathological synaptic pruning by microglia in neurodegeneration,"Synapse loss is the major correlate of cognitive impairment in many neurodegenerative diseases. Recent literature suggests that microglia, which mediate synaptic pruning during brain development, can be responsible for synapse loss in neurodegeneration. Although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, growing evidence indicates that dysfunctional microglia affect synapses number and function in pathology. Genome-wide association studies reveal that the majority of risk genes associated with neurodegenerative disorders are highly expressed in microglia. While such studies clearly implicate these cells in the pathogenesis of the disease, little is known about the causal mechanisms that link microglial risk variants to loss of synapses. 
We will identify the molecular mechanisms involved in microglia-mediated synapse loss. We will also generate novel in vitro and ex vivo models of ‘risk microglia’, by introducing genetic variants associated with cognitive impairment –alone or in combination- specifically in microglia, taking advantage of CRISPR/ Cas9 genome editing techniques. These goals will be achieved by combining cutting-edge transcriptomics and proteomics with mouse models of intense synaptic remodelling, to reveal the unique molecular signature of ‘shaper microglia’. A multidisciplinary approach will allow the extensive characterisation of risk models, by combining metabolic analysis, synaptic phagocytosis and degradation assays, with super-resolution microscopy, and novel genetically encoded labelling methods. With the knowledge generated here, we aim at developing and validating in vivo novel drugs- and nanobodies-based approaches for effective targeting of pathological pruning. 
In summary, REMIND will focus on:
1) Identifying molecular players in microglial-mediated synapse loss
2) Generating ‘risk microglia’ models, to asses the role of genetic variants associated with neurodegeneration

Horizon 2020,EngineeringBAP,Engineering brain activity patterns for therapeutics of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders,"Neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders are complex dysfunctions of neuronal circuits. Their treatmenthas been limited by the lack of non-invasive methods for measuring the underlying circuit dysfunctions, andfor direct and localized modifications of these circuits. We propose minimally invasive technologies formeasuring brain activity and functional connectivity patterns, and for manipulating them directly in vivo tocorrect the abnormal behavioural phenotypes (in rodents with potential scalability to non-human primates andhumans). First, we present a proof-of-principle study on mutant zebrafish, in which we correct whole-brainlevel abnormal activity patterns and behaviours by using large-scale single-neuron resolution measurements,and by simultaneously modulating multiple sub-networks via neuromodulator cocktails. Next, we presentstrong preliminary data in rodents and our plan: (1) For manipulating brain circuits in rodents/primates noninvasively,we will develop technologies that can deliver receptive-specific neuromodulators to spatiallyprecise brain targets without opening/damaging the blood brain barrier. These methods will employ engineeredultrasound pulses and drug carrying microparticles we designed. (2) For reading out the brain circuits inrodents/primates, we will develop flexible low-power neuromorphic μECoG circuits that can detect singleneuron signals from superficial cortical layers of many cortical areas simultaneously. (3) Finally, these noveltechnologies will be comprehensively evaluated on a mouse model of obsessive compulsivity and anxietyusing a battery of behavioural tasks to reverse the pathological symptoms (beyond what is achievable byexisting approaches).

Horizon 2020,NEUROFLIES,Drosophila sechellia: a novel model to investigate nervous system and behavioral evolution,"How animals’ extraordinarily diverse behaviors have evolved is unknown. Relating interspecific behavioral differences to anatomical or physiological distinctions in neural circuits, and causal genetic variation, offers a powerful approach to inform how nervous systems develop, function and change.

Understanding behavioral and nervous system evolution requires deep investment in select species. We propose to establish a new model neurogenetic system: Drosophila sechellia, an island endemic that is closely related to D. melanogaster and D. simulans. While D. sechellia retains global genomic and superficial morphological similarity to its cosmopolitan generalist cousins, this species has adapted to a unique ecological niche, using Morinda fruit as a sole host for feeding and breeding. The project has three aims:

Aim 1. Establishment of a D. sechellia (neuro)genetic toolkit: we will build essential genetic reagents for generation and maintenance of animals of desired genotypes, for neurogenetic manipulations, and for recombination mapping-based approaches.

Aim 2. Behavioral, neuroanatomical and molecular phenomics: systematic comparison of D. sechellia, D. simulans and D. melanogaster for their behaviors, their neuroanatomy and their neuro-molecular expression properties will reveal how D. sechellia has adapted to its niche, and will provide multiple entry-points to relate molecular, neuronal and behavioral differences between these species.

Aim 3. Defining the genetic basis and functional significance of a neuronal adaptation in D. sechellia: through high-resolution mapping and allele swap approaches, we will identify the causal genetic changes underlying a neural adaption in D. sechellia, and its physiological and behavioral significance.

This project will establish a powerful new model system for evolutionary neuroscience (and many other fields) and provide fundamental insights into the origins and mechanisms of nervous system and behavioral diversification.",Richard Roland Benton,University of Lausanne,Switzerland,-,833548,ERC-2018-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),LS5 - Neuroscience & Disorders of the Nervous Systems,2018,43739,45747,2327547,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/833548,University of Lausanne
Horizon 2020,CERDEV,Transcriptional controls over cerebellar neuron differentiation and circuit assembly,"The cerebellum is a critical regulator of motor function, which acts to integrate ongoing body states, sensory inputs and desired outcomes to adjust motor output. This motor control is achieved by a relatively small number of neuron types receiving two main sources of inputs and forming a single output pathway, the axons of Purkinje cells. Although the cerebellum is one of the first structures of the brain to differentiate, it undergoes a prolonged differentiation period such that mature cellular and circuit configuration is achieved only late after birth. Despite the functional importance of this structure, the molecular mechanisms that control type-specific cerebellar neurons generation, differentiation, and circuit assembly are poorly understood and are the topic of the present study.In my research program, I propose to investigate the transcriptional programs that control the generation of distinct subtypes of cerebellar neurons from progenitors, including Purkinje cells, granule cells and molecular layer interneurons (Work Package 1); the diversity of Purkinje cells across cerebellar regions (Work Package 2) and the postnatal differentiation and circuit integration of granule cells and molecular layer interneurons (Work Package 3). The general bases of the approach I propose consist in: i) specifically label cerebellar neuron progenitors and their progeny at sequential developmental time points pre- and post-natally using birthdate-based tagging, ii) FAC-sort these distinct cell types, iii) isolate these cells and identify their transcriptional signatures with single-cell resolution, iv) functionally interrogate top candidate genes and associated transcriptional programs using in vivo gain- and loss-of-function approaches.

Horizon 2020,ENTRAINER,Enhancing brain function and cognition via artificial entrainment of neural oscillations,"Neural oscillations are ubiquitous in the human brain and have been implicated in diverse cognitive functions to support both neural communication and plasticity. Their functional relevance is further supported by a large number of studies linking various cognitive deficits (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD) with abnormal neural oscillations. However, this field of research faces two important problems: First, there is only correlative, but no causal evidence linking cognitive deficits to abnormal neural oscillations in humans. Second, there is virtually no theory-driven mechanistic approach that generates insights into how oscillations within and across neural networks are linked to human behavior. In this project, I propose to take decisive steps to provide a long-needed neurophysiological characterization—via (1) computational modelling, (2) electrophysiological measures, and (3) novel non-invasive manipulations of cortical rhythms—on how neural oscillations contribute to two types of cognitive processes that are fundamental for many aspects of human behavior: attention and short-term memory. I will go a step further by demonstrating that it is possible to augment performance in these cognitive functions with the design of non-invasive brain stimulation protocols individually tailored to the theory-driven neurocomputational characterizations and electrophysiological signatures of each individual. This will result in the applied goal of deriving new neuro-computational assays that can detect deviant network interactions causally related to cognitive functions, which is key for then renormalizing those functions in neuropsychological conditions such as ADHD. Thus, if successful, my proposed work will ultimately result in novel, low-cost, and painless non-invasive neural interventions for a wide range of neuropsychological disorders tied to abnormal neural oscillations.",Rafael Polania,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,758604,ERC-2017-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),LS5 - Neuroscience & Disorders of the Nervous Systems,2017,43132,45322,1497104,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/758604,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,NeuroStemCircuit,Neural Circuit Regulation of Adult Brain Stem Cells,"In the adult mammalian brain, neural stem cells (NSCs) residing in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), give rise to new olfactory bulb neurons and glia throughout life. Adult V-SVZ NSC are highly heterogeneous. Stem cells co-exist in quiescent and activated states and reside in regionally-distinct V-SVZ domains and produce different subtypes of olfactory bulb neurons and glia. However, whether this heterogeneity is due to intrinsic fate commitment or whether it is dynamically responsive to external changes is still debated. Moreover, the mechanisms that modulate the balance between activation and dormancy are largely unknown. It is emerging that physiological states modulate V-SVZ cell behaviour and impact adult neurogenesis. We propose to investigate whether physiologically distinct states result in the recruitment of regionally distinct pools of adult V-SVZ neural stem cells. In Aim 1, we will map the domains of stem cell activation and cell types generated in different states in male and female mice. In Aim 2, we will perform large-scale single cell sequencing to decode stem cell heterogeneity and develop novel fate mapping strategies to selectively target different stem cell populations. We will also define the connectivity of different populations of interneuron subtypes. In Aim 3, we will define how the choroid plexus and long- range innervation differentially affect V-SVZ stem cell recruitment in different states using approaches to manipulate neural circuit activity. Together these experiments will provide a conceptual breakthrough into illuminating the logic of adult neural stem cell heterogeneity, and how regionally distinct adult neural stem cells integrate long-range signals from remote brain areas to respond to signals for on-demand neurogenesis or gliogenesis.",Fiona Doetsch,University of Basel,Switzerland,-,789328,ERC-2017-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),LS5 - Neuroscience & Disorders of the Nervous Systems,2017,43374,45747,2499833,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/789328,University of Basel
Horizon 2020,WePredict,Microbiota and immune responses at weaning predict the susceptibility to chronic inflammatory diseases in adulthood,"Microbiota dysbiosis is associated with chronic inflammatory diseases such as allergy, inflammatory bowel diseases, cancer and metabolism-related disorders. It has been reported that exposure to microbial and dietary components early in life may program the immune system to develop tolerance or susceptibility to chronic inflammatory diseases with age. We have recently showed that vigorous immune responses induced by gut microbiota at weaning, prevent the development and exacerbation of chronic inflammatory diseases in adult mice. Such immune alterations are termed the “weaning reaction”. Antibiotic exposure or excessive fats intake during this critical window deregulates the weaning reaction and increases the subsequent susceptibility to develop immunopathology. Induction of regulatory T cells (Treg) or B cells by microbiota at this stage of breast-feeding cessation, but not later, prevents the pathological memory that is assessed as increased susceptibility to colitis or obesity in adulthood. However, how perturbing the generation of these cells, at a critical developmental period causes long-lasting susceptibility to pathology remains largely unknown. Here we aim to 1) validate microbial and nutritional signatures at weaning that predict the susceptibility to adult pathology using machine-learning algorithms on large mouse datasets and by gnotobiotic models; 2) define the molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of weaning reaction by Treg and B cells; 3) identify the kind of immune memory carried by Treg and B cells from weaning until adulthood, through exploring the antibody repertoires and epigenetic modifications using high-throughput sequencing; 4) reverse the pathological memory in adult mice using immuno-adoptive transfer or successive colonization by neonatal-like gut bacteria.

Horizon 2020,CIRCADYN,Regulation and relevance of circadian leukocyte dynamics for skin immune homeostasis,"The skin is the largest organ of the body and represents the primary physical barrier to the environment. Circadian, ~24h rhythms in the environment have emerged as important regulators of the immune system, yet, the circadian dynamics of leukocyte turnover and function in the skin are completely unknown. Insights into the mechanisms occurring at this host-environment interface will be of key importance to understand how rhythmicity in the immune system is achieved. This will produce knowledge to optimize adjuvant design and maximize adaptive immune responses such as required in vaccinations, ultimately providing a time window for therapy.

We will elucidate how circadian dynamics in leukocyte input and output to the skin interplay to create oscillatory numbers of leukocytes in this tissue. We will assess the impact of lineage-specific rhythmicity and arrhythmicity on skin immune homeostasis using an innovative combination of novel genetic tools. We will mechanistically assess how circadian leukocyte dynamics in the skin are governed at a higher level by the sympathetic nervous system. We will finally unravel the cause and the functional relevance of circadian leukocyte dynamics in the skin by assessing whether they primarily represent a response to exogenous factors or whether they are caused by physiological tissue turnover in response to daily recurring mechanical stress. Based on these data we will create a mathematical model determining circadian skin leukocyte turnover in a quantitative manner.

The project combines the disciplines of immunology and chronobiology by obtaining unprecedented insights into circadian immunity in the skin, a critical epithelial barrier site, which is of broad impact for both fields. Our extensive experience in the rhythmic control of both the innate and adaptive immune system makes us well poised to unravel the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate circadian leukocyte dynamics in the skin.",Christoph Scheiermann,University of Geneva,Switzerland,-,101001233,ERC-2020-COG,Consolidator Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS6 - Immunity, Infection & Immunotherapy",2020,44470,46295,1999963,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101001233,University of Geneva
Horizon 2020,CardiacStroma,Tissue Cytokines at the Nexus of  Immune Cell-Cardiac Stromal Cell Interaction,"Myocarditis is an acute inflammatory heart disease that can progress to chronic cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Since there is no specific treatment recommendation available for myocarditis and subsequent inflammatory cardiomyopathy, there is an urgent need to dissect the pathological principles underlying cardiac inflammation and to target those molecular pathways that are at the core of the pathological process.
My recent research places cross-reactive CD4+ T cells at the center of inflammatory cardiomyopathy pathogenesis. The activation and sustenance of cardiotropic T cells is controlled in immune cell-nurturing niches that are generated by fibroblastic stromal cells through the provision of tissue cytokines of the TGF-beta superfamily. The overarching goal of this project is therefore to decipher the molecular pathways that govern the interaction of immune cells with stromal cells in the cardiac tissue through the combination of state-of-the-art pre-clinical models, novel methods from quantitative systems biology, functional validation by antibody blockade, and assessment of the translational relevance through the analysis of cardiac biopsies from human patients. The generation of antibodies that neutralize a distinct set of tissue cytokines or their inhibitors will not only serve as functional validation, but will open possibilities for future translational development. Moreover, the utilization of spatial transcriptomics for the analysis of human heart samples will open new avenues for innovative research both in immunology and in cardiology. 
Overall, I expect that the planned research program will deliver (i) novel targets for the treatment of myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy, (ii) validated prototype antibodies that ameliorate cardiac inflammation through the manipulation of stromal cell-immune cell interaction, and (iii) a comprehensive analysis of the changes in the cellular and molecular landscape during cardiac inflammation in humans.",Burkhard Ludewig,Canton of St. Gallen-Hospital,Switzerland,-,101019872,ERC-2020-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS6 - Immunity, Infection & Immunotherapy",2020,44562,46387,2424000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101019872,Cantonal hospital of St.Gallen
Horizon 2020,AimingT6SS,Mechanisms of dynamic localization of the bacterial Type 6 secretion system assembly,"The Type 6 secretion system (T6SS) allows Gram-negative bacteria to deliver toxins into both eukaryotic and bacterial target cells and thus cause disease or kill competitors. T6SS is composed of four main parts: a membrane complex, a baseplate and a long spring-like sheath wrapped around an inner tube. Sheath contraction generates a large amount of energy to push the tube with associated toxins through the baseplate and membrane complex out of the cell. However, the reach of the T6SS tube is limited and thus a direct contact with the target membrane and precise positioning of T6SS assembly is required for protein translocation. In this proposal, we will unravel principles of spatial and temporal coordination of T6SS assembly that we have recently observed in several bacteria. We will study how Pseudomonas sense attacks from neighbouring bacteria to dynamically localize its T6SS to quickly retaliate. We will describe how Acinetobacter initiate and position T6SS assembly in response to peptidoglycan damage, changes in osmolarity and cell-cell interactions. We will identify the principles and the role of the polar assembly of T6SS in intracellular pathogens Francisella and Burkholderia. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we will identify and characterize proteins interacting with the core components of T6SS and test their role in initiation and positioning of T6SS assembly. We will search for peptidoglycan remodelling enzymes required for T6SS assembly. We will use advanced microscopy techniques to describe dynamic localization of proteins upon T6SS activation to establish the order of their assembly. We will quantify how much T6SS aiming increases efficiency of protein delivery and T6SS function during bacterial competition and pathogenesis.

Horizon 2020,PATHOCODE,Molecular pathology of anti-viral T cell responses in the central nervous system,"Immune responses against viruses in the central nervous system (CNS) can result in devastating outcomes. Even non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions, which purge viruses from neurons without triggering cell death, can induce permanent damage. Yet, how this immune response irreversibly disrupts neuronal homeostasis remains unclear.
Here, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell engagement with infected neurons and their consequences on neuron function in vivo. We hypothesize that inflammatory signalling in neurons, induced by non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions, triggers metabolic and epigenetic changes that underpin permanent neuronal dysfunction.
""PATHOCODE"" will test this hypothesis by harnessing a unique animal model of T cell-driven virus encephalitis in the following objectives: 1. Discern neuronal subset-specific vulnerabilities and antigen-dependent versus bystander effects in the inflamed CNS. We will perform single nucleus RNA sequencing to examine whether T cell engagement (a) differentially affects molecularly distinct neurons, and (b) affects non-targeted, uninfected neurons. 2. Uncover the consequences of non-cytolytic T cell engagement on neuronal metabolism. We will use cell-specific mitochondrial reporter mice to investigate immune-driven metabolic adaptation of neurons in vivo. 3. Determine how non-cytolytic T cell engagement affects the neuronal epigenome. We will employ cell-specific nucleus/ribosome reporter mice to elucidate how T cell engagement affects the translatome and epigenome of infected cells. 4. Rescue T cell-mediated neuronal dysfunction by restoring metabolic pathways. We will exploit recent CRISPR/Cas9 technological advances to restore neuronal gene expression and uncover the relevance of immune-driven metabolic and epigenomic changes to disease.

Horizon 2020,SNUGly,Systems-level novel understanding of anti-glycan immunity,"Intestinal bacteria have an enormous influence on health, both in the form of major pathogens and as major constituents of the microbiota. We have demonstrated that high-affinity secretory antibodies (sIgA) offer huge potential to protect from infection and to manipulate microbiota composition. However, designing good oral vaccines to induce high-affinity sIgA is a compound problem. Most protective anti-bacterial sIgA targets bacterial glycans, requiring an understanding of inherently difficult glycan biochemistry. We also need to deliver intact antigen via the highly degradative environment of the intestine. Whole-cell inactivated oral vaccines can induce high-affinity sIgA against some glycan structures, but we have an incomplete picture of what determines the success/failure of these vaccines. By combining advanced biophysical methods (e.g. atomic force spectroscopy), fluorescence and electron microscopy, and synthetic biology, we aim to remove this mystery. Our objectives are:
1) Generate a ""toolbox"" for glycan-binding antibody research: Recombinant antibodies, BCR knock-in mice and defined glycan antigens as purified molecules, on whole bacteria or on virus-like particle will be developed for model antigens: Salmonella Typhimurium O-antigen and the E.coli K100 capsule. 
2) Determine the quantitative relationship between glycan antigen sampling into gut-associated lymphoid tissues and particle size, glycan flexibility/structure, digestion resistance and natural IgA binding.
3) Determine how biophysical properties of glycan antigens affect B cell antigen uptake, T cell help and antibody affinity maturation.
4) Combine models of antigen sampling efficiency and anti-glycan antibody affinity maturation to generate a systems-level model of mucosal vaccine efficacy.
This will uncover the fundamental principles governing the induction of high-affinity anti-glycan sIgA, driving urgently required progress in mucosal vaccine design

Horizon 2020,ImAgine,Exploring the link between innate Immunity and cellular Aging,"The innate immune system has evolved signalling receptors, which detect various stresses including microbial infection but also signals emanating from non-infectious cellular damage. Upon activation, these signalling receptors can trigger a variety of distinct effector responses collectively aimed towards maintaining the integrity of the host. The recognition of cytosolic DNA through the cGAS-STING pathway is a fundamental mechanism through which pathogens and cellular stress evoke an inflammatory response. Recently, we discovered a new role of the cGAS-STING pathway in promoting cellular senescence, a critical stress response program that is emerging as a key driver of aging. On the basis of this finding, the overarching gaol of ImAgine is to further explore the molecular links that exist between the mechanisms of innate immune signalling and those underlying aging processes. Specifically, we will address whether the cGAS-STING pathway acts as a contributor to age-associated phenotypes and we will interrogate mitotic perturbations as a physiological source of age-associated damage that activates the innate DNA sensing machinery. Another intriguing possibility emerging from our work is that cellular senescence is relevant for the host response against pathogens. Utilising an array of genetic and pharmacological tools, we will challenge this idea and molecularly decipher the role of senescent cells in physiological models of acute and chronic infection. A detailed picture of the interplay between innate immune pathways and cellular ageing will not only be a critical step towards a global understanding of fundamental host response mechanisms, but may also provide new concepts for the treatment of diseases that are associated with infectious diseases or ageing.",Andrea Ablasser,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,804933,ERC-2018-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS6 - Immunity, Infection & Immunotherapy",2018,43466,45291,1489520,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/804933,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,MitoGuide,Integration and adaptation of impaired mitochondrial fitness in orchestrating T cell dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment,"Cancer immunotherapies harnessing the tumoricidal activity of tumor-reactive T cells represent a major breakthrough in the current paradigm for treating cancer patents. However, the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments found in solid tumors present challenges by restricting the tumoricidal functions and metabolic fitness of infiltrating tumor-reactive T cells. Given that the activation-induced metabolic switch is tightly intertwined with T cell activities, restoring the metabolic fitness of T cells represents a promising strategy for strengthening anti-tumor immunity. However, the success of this strategy relies on our understanding of the underlying mechanisms utilized by tumor cells to abolish the metabolic fitness of T cells, and of how metabolic programming controls T cell functions. Based on our preliminary results, we postulate that tumor cells disrupt the mitochondrial dynamics of tumor-infiltrating T cells by interrupting mitophagy. This causes a metabolic crisis for the infiltrating T cells in sustaining their metabolic fitness and flexibility. Furthermore, we hypothesize that declined mitochondria-derived retrograde signals resulted from mitochondrial dysfunction may lead to T cell dysfunction/exhaustion and altered immune responses through epigenetic reprogramming and altered proteome-metabolic regulatory circuits. The objectives of this proposal are to delineate how tumor cells influence the mitochondrial dynamics of T cells and define the unexplored immunometabolic regulations of T cell functions that are controlled by mitochondria. Lastly, we aim to new methods to restore missing retrograde signals in T cells, which could allow them to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction-induced epigenetic and transcriptomic changes. This work represents an entirely new perspective on control of T cell functions by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and it may reveal new dimensions of immunometabolic regulation.",Ping-Chih Ho,University of Lausanne,Switzerland,-,802773,ERC-2018-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS6 - Immunity, Infection & Immunotherapy",2018,43497,45322,1499990,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/802773,University of Lausanne
Horizon 2020,MADEFUN,Regulation of Brain Macrophage Development and Function,"Macrophages are part of the mononuclear phagocyte system and play critical roles in innate immune responses. They further exert crucial organ-specific functions to warrant tissue homeostasis. Most macrophages are long-lived and derive from embryonic precursors. The central nervous system (CNS) contains several macrophage populations, of which microglia are the most prominent and abundant population residing in the CNS parenchyma. Besides being implicated in CNS pathologies, microglia guide neuronal development, are critical for neurogenesis and contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. At the interface between the brain and the periphery reside choroid plexus, perivascular and meningeal macrophages (‘border-associated’ macrophages, BAMs). While they mostly also originate from embryonic precursors, the differentiation cues and their specific roles in development and in health and disease are poorly understood. Here we will delineate the spatiotemporal emergence of BAMs and microglia, the impact of the local microenvironment on their phenotype and function, and their role in brain development. We will further analyze the role of BAMs and microglia in physiological and neuropathological conditions (neurodegeneration, CNS infection and inflammation). We have recently described a novel ‘microglia-specific’ conditional mouse and we are currently establishing an inducible system to specifically manipulate BAMs. We will use these to genetically intervene in different cytokine signaling pathways in combination with fate-mapping in vivo.

Horizon 2020,InflamCellDeath,"Mechanism and function of gasdermin-induced inflammatory cell death
","Pyroptosis is a lytic pro-inflammatory type of programmed cell death that is induced by inflammatory caspases, a family of proteases that control the innate immune response to infection, injury or noxious substances. Inflammatory caspases are activated within so-called inflammasomes, cytosolic signalling platforms that are assembled by pattern recognition receptors upon the detection of pathogen- or host-derived danger signals. Pyroptosis is essential for antimicrobial host defense, but also promotes the concomitant release of inflammatory danger signals and leaderless cytokines that is detrimental during chronic inflammatory disease.Recently it was found that pyroptosis is caused by the cleavage of a single caspase substrate called gasdermin-D. This cleavage generates a cytotoxic N-terminal fragment of gasdermin-D that targets the plasma membrane, where it forms large permeability pores and thus causes pyroptotic cell death. Gasdermin-D is only one member of the larger gasdermin protein family, an emerging group of cell death effectors that share its pore-forming cytotoxic activity and that appear to be major regulators of inflammatory necrotic cell death.The main goal of this proposal is to comprehensively characterize the function of gasdermins in anti-microbial host defense, to investigate the consequences of gasdermin-D pore formation to the host cell and to elucidate the pathways that regulate gasdermin activation. My objectives are:1) to define the role of gasdermin-D in inflammasome-dependent anti-bacterial host defense2) to study the role of membrane repair in restricting gasdermin-D-induced membrane3) to characterize the function and regulation of other gasdermin family members during infectionBy characterizing the mechanism and function of gasdermin-induced cell death in host-defense and inflammation this project may contribute to the development of novel therapies for infectious as well as inflammatory diseases.",Petr Broz,University of Lausanne,Switzerland,-,770988,ERC-2017-COG,Consolidator Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS6 - Immunity, Infection & Immunotherapy",2017,43160,45351,1999176,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/770988,University of Lausanne
Horizon 2020,PneumoCaTChER,The role of cell-to-cell variability in pneumococcal virulence and antibiotic resistance,"Within clonal bacterial populations not all cells exhibit the same phenotype, even though they grow in the same environment. The molecular sources contributing to phenotypic variation are diverse and can originate from noise in gene expression to heterogeneity in growth rates or cell cycle state. Phenotypic variation helps pathogenic bacteria to elude the host immune response or resist antibiotic pressure. Vice versa, there is cell-to-cell variability in the host’s response towards pathogens that can be exploited by bacteria. How the combined cellular heterogeneity of both host and microbe contribute to infection outcome is poorly understood. The role of phenotypic variation on antibiotic resistance development is also unclear.Recently, we developed novel single cell imaging systems as well as genetic engineering and screening platforms for application to the important opportunistic human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition, we generated a dual-transcriptomics overview of pneumococcal infection of human lung epithelial cells and setup collaborations to perform several infection models. This now places us in an excellent position to investigate the mechanisms and the importance of single cell behaviour for pneumococcal virulence and antibiotic resistance.The driving hypothesis of this application is that the combined heterogeneity of host cells and pneumococci influences infection and antibiotic therapy outcome. To test this, we will use innovative approaches for infection biology by combining synthetic biology and quantitative single cell biology including single cell RNA-seq, CRISPRi, engineered bistable switches and microfluidics. We will reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying cell-to-cell variability and its importance in virulence and antibiotic resistance. Insights obtained in this project will lead to a better understanding of phenotypic variation and might result in new treatment strategies for pneumococcal infections.",Jan-Willem Veening,University of Lausanne,Switzerland,-,771534,ERC-2017-COG,Consolidator Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS6 - Immunity, Infection & Immunotherapy",2017,43405,45230,1999735,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/771534,University of Lausanne
Horizon 2020,PhotoPHARMA,Light-induced synthesis of protein-drug conjugates for imaging and therapy,"The ability to functionalise a biologically active protein with a range of different cargo molecules is crucial to accessing new tools for use in fundamental science and clinical medicine. For instance, antibody-conjugates that graft reporter molecules including fluorescent tags or radioactive metal ion chelates play vital roles in diagnostic imaging with optical and nuclear medicine techniques like positron emission tomography (PET). State-of-the-art advances in chemotherapy also take advantage of the biophysical properties of antibodies in the design of highly potent antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that facilitate specific delivery and uptake of cytotoxic or radiotoxic payloads to disease lesions. Surprisingly, almost all existing methods to produce protein-conjugates rely on thermally-mediated coupling chemistries. In PhotoPHARMA, the goal is to break away from the convention of using heat to drive protein functionalisation by designing new photochemical reagents that are activated by the absorption of light. Light-induced activation has the potential to solve many of the practical issues encountered in the synthesis of radiolabelled antibodies and other protein-conjugates. The work encompasses 4 main Objectives:  Objective 1. Explore the biochemical scope of light-induced reactions for bimolecular protein-ligation  Objective 2.

Horizon 2020,DRUGSBUGS,"Improved therapies for soil-transmitted helminthiases: exploring pharmacomicrobiomics, novel drugs and microfluidic assay platforms","An estimated 1.5 billion people are infected with soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) causing a global burden of 1.9 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Current treatment options are limited. Preliminary studies in my lab hint towards a gut microbiome mechanism responsible for treatment failures of the most efficacious treatment currently available, albendazole-ivermectin. I propose an innovative 5-year project (“DRUGSBUGS”) that holds promise for major breakthroughs in anthelminthic drug discovery and development. I will deepen the understanding of current and potentially upcoming anthelminthics, in particular the microbiome-driven modulation of anthelminthic treatment. I will investigate underlying gut microbial structures in human stool samples associated with efficacy of albendazole-ivermectin treatment. Findings will be experimentally validated in vitro and in vivo. In addition, I speculate that emodepside will emerge as a novel key player in the anthelminthic drug armamentarium, which will enhance efficacy and reduce the risk of selection of resistant helminth populations. DRUGSBUGS proposes two Phase 2a dose selection trials with emodepside against Trichuris trichiura and hookworm in adults. Subsequent Phase 2b studies will assess whether emodepside is superior to albendazole against hookworm and T. trichiura. Using a microsampling technique, I will characterize the pharmacokinetics of emodepside in patients infected with T. trichiura and hookworm. In parallel, investing in innovative new technologies in the field of drug discovery will facilitate the discovery and development of the next generation of anthelminthics. I propose to study drug effects on motility and viability of different STH larvae applying electrical impedance spectroscopy on a microfluidic chip platform.

Horizon 2020,EPOCHAL,Beyond seasonal suffering: Effects of Pollen on Cardiorespiratory Health and Allergies,"As climate change increases the duration and intensity of the pollen season, allergies to airborne pollen are increasingly common in Europe. Yet, it is not well recognized that high pollen concentrations may increase respiratory and cardiovascular events, leading to mortality and excess hospitalizations. I aim to investigate how short-term exposure to pollen is related to mortality, hospitalization and allergic symptoms, both on its own and synergistically with air pollution and weather.
I will develop spatiotemporal exposure models of pollen for the years 2003-2022 based on a network of 14 pollen measurements stations in Switzerland. Taking advantage of large, real-world datasets without selection bias (Swiss National Cohort) and the efficient case-crossover study design, I will investigate the population effects of pollen on daily respiratory and cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization, also accounting for variation in air pollution and weather conditions. To explore individual sensitivity, I will conduct repeated measurements of lung function and airway inflammation in a dedicated panel of 400 allergic patients complemented with opportunistic repeated accounts of self-reported symptoms from the “e-symptoms” app by Swiss Allergy Centre. To provide personalized prevention recommendations and enhance quality of life for the allergic population, I will derive exposure-response relationships based on prevalent pollen, air pollution and weather triggers and individual symptom reports, allowing me to ultimately forecast symptom severity using machine learning techniques.
This highly innovative project utilizes available nationwide health datasets and systematic novel data collection methods (in the in-depth panel study), to better understand the role of pollen in respiratory and cardiovascular diseases at both personalized and population levels.

Horizon 2020,TAVI4Life,A lifelong transcatheter aortic valve prosthesis,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) techniques have revolutionized the therapy options for valvular heart disease. Initially developed for elderly high-risk patients, TAVI is being extended to younger patients and may become a first-line treatment in the near future. 
However, the available bioprostheses for TAVI are prone to degeneration, and patients may thus require multiple re-interventions, significantly affecting their life quality. To date, a native-analogous TAVI prosthesis with in-situ remodeling capacity does not exist. Tissue engineered (TE) heart valves represent a potential solution, but are not yet suitable for high-pressure applications and lack clinical translation because of uncontrolled in-vivo remodeling, impairing their long-term functionality.
In the TAVI4Life project, I aim to develop and validate a novel TAVI prosthesis for young patients with the unique ability to transform into a fully autologous valve within the body and last for life. This project will go far beyond previous TE concepts by engineering a novel decellularized human ECM and a bioresorbable stent and applying an unconventional bioengineering approach combining in-vitro, in-silico, and in-vivo TE methods. First, I will engineer and characterize a clinical-grade ECM for high-pressure conditions and test patient-specific immuno- and hemocompatibility profile (in-vitro). Next, using computational modeling, I will design and develop a bioresorbable stent and implement an analytical valve design to develop the transcatheter prosthesis (in-silico). Finally, I will evaluate valve performance and remodeling in a preclinical large animal model (in-vivo). This highly multidisciplinary approach will lead to a valve prosthesis that lasts for life, as guided in-situ tissue remodeling will enable their long-term performance. The clinical impact will be enormous as, particularly for young patients, the TAVI4Life will significantly enhance their life expectancy and quality of life.",Maximilian Y.

Horizon 2020,IBAF,Inhibiting BAF to Improve Gene Delivery,"Safe and efficient delivery of nucleic acids to tissues and cells is a shared challenge in the clinical translation of gene therapy and gene editing. At the intracellular level, DNA delivery is hindered by endo/lysosomal sequestration, inefficient transport into the nucleus and a retention mechanism mediated by the barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) protein that detects, clusters and locks away intruding double-stranded DNA in membrane cages. The first two of these intracellular obstacles are well-known bottlenecks and are being addressed by many laboratories. However, preliminary in vitro data suggest the detrimental impact of BAF’s mechanism on transgene expression is underestimated. We hypothesize that transiently suppressing BAF or one of its regulating factors will increase the cytosolic availability and mobility of transfected DNA, facilitating its transport to the nucleus and ultimately boosting transfection efficiency. We will tackle this rather uninvestigated mechanism through two parallel strategies: i) identifying novel small-molecule inhibitors of BAF or its regulators via high-throughput screening of chemical libraries, and ii) producing a recombinant kinase that phosphorylates BAF in situ and thus supresses its DNA-clustering function. The BAF suppressors will be co-delivered to cells with rationally-designed nucleoprotein nanoparticles consisting of a reporter plasmid and a dual-function fusion protein to facilitate endocytosis and endosomal escape. The combined transfection-enhancing effect of the BAF suppressors and the nanoparticles will be extensively characterized in vitro, and in vivo proof-of-concept will be obtained in mice. Besides expanding our fundamental knowledge on this unexplored DNA retention mechanism, the project will provide powerful transfection enhancers that can boost already-existing gene delivery platforms (viral and non-viral), so that these can reach their full potential for gene therapy and gene-editing applications.",Jean-Christophe Leroux,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,884505,ERC-2019-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS7 - Prevention, Diagnosis & Treatment of Human Diseases",2019,44136,45961,2390625,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/884505,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,IMPACT,High-Dimensional single cell mapping of inflammatory disease signatures in monozygotic twins,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease, where immune cell invasion into the central nervous system causes immunopathology and neurological deficit. Although disease-modifying therapies dramatically reduce disease activity, they hold the potential for severe adverse effects while long-term disability prospects remain poor. Moreover, there is to date no biomarker for monitoring the disease activity and to guide therapy decisions. I propose that the key to identifying such biomarkers is to combine single-cell mapping of leukocytes across well-curated patient cohorts with unbiased machine-learning based data interrogation. Using such an approach, we have already delineated a disease signature in a helper T cell population specific for MS. However, the immune compartment of cross-sectional cohorts is influenced by the individual genetic make up, which masks disease-specific signals and hinders a more precise characterisation of involved immune cell populations. To eliminate genetic influences, I here propose in aim 1 to interrogate the immune compartment of a unique cohort of monozygotic twin pairs -discordant for MS- and deeply analyse peripheral blood lymphocytes by single-cell mass cytometry, combined TcR and single cell sequencing, and epigenetic profiling.  aim 2 to develop representation-learning methods to account for the paired genetics of twins or longitudinal samples and to include clinical covariates into the high-dimensional data set. aim 3 to use well-defined patient samples of MS-like disorders (MS-Mimics) and longitudinal samples of patients undergoing disease-modifying therapy (e.g. B cell depletion, autologous stem cell transplant) using single-cell mass cytometry. Ultimately, the goal is to reduce the dimensionality of disease signature(s) towards a clinically translatable low-dimensional biomarker that could be identified and quantified by routine methods available in the clinics.",Burkhard Becher,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,882424,ERC-2019-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS7 - Prevention, Diagnosis & Treatment of Human Diseases",2019,44197,46387,2492221,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/882424,University of Zurich
Horizon 2020,TETHER,Targeting the essentialome of radiotherapy-resistant cancer,"More than 50% of the cancer patients undergo irradiation as part of their cancer treatment. Although radiotherapy (RT) significantly contributes to cancer cure, local therapy resistance and the subsequent emergence of distant metastasis remain major obstacles for its success. The molecular mechanisms underlying tumor cell-intrinsic RT resistance are ill-defined. It is therefore crucial to better define these mechanisms and identify new vulnerabilities of RT-resistant tumors in order to decrease the current annual cancer mortality of >1.3 million persons in EU member states alone.

In the TETHER project, I will address the problem of RT resistance by synergizing the power of genetic essentiality analyses with unique mouse models and organoids that we have established. We recently found that members of the shieldin and CST complexes are essential for tumor cells to survive irradiation, while causing PARP inhibitor resistance when lost in BRCA1-deficient tumors. Based on this unexpected finding, I have started a new line of research to dissect the RT ""essentialome"". As I show with the discovery and functional characterization of ERCC6l2 as a novel DNA repair factor in this network, the technology we have in place is perfectly suited to tackle this question. In addition, we will apply distinct CRISPR/Cas9-based tests to map the functional interactome of genes that are essential for RT resistance. 

To follow the plasticity and RT escape of tumor cells in vivo, we have also developed innovative model systems. Similar to the situation in cancer patients, we observe that residual cancer cells in our mouse models escape the deadly effects of RT by local resistance or metastasis formation. Thus, these models provide a unique opportunity to explore and target RT escape mechanisms. I am convinced that the combination of these state-of-the-art approaches will yield highly useful information for designing individualized approaches to improve RT response in cancer patients.

Horizon 2020,TIL-FIT,Increasing the fitness of tumor-infiltrating T cells for cellular immunotherapy,"Adoptive T cell therapies (ACTs) are emerging as a promising strategy to treat cancer. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are expanded ex vivo, selected for recognition of neoantigens, further expanded and then infused back into patients. This procedure requires extensive culturing and expansion of TILs during which many T cell clonotypes are lost. As tumor-reactive TILs are often exhausted and tend to be overgrown by functional, non-specific T cells in culture, the chance to identify potent tumor-reactive T cells dramatically decreases. Moreover, extensive expansion of T cells diminishes their anti-tumor activity and persistence in the body after adoptive transfers. Thus, improving the fitness of T cells is crucial to increase the success rate of ACTs and make this therapy accessible to a broad spectrum of cancer patients. Our first aim is to increase the fitness of T cells by designing metabolic and pharmacological interventions based on proteomic profiles of TILs from patients with liver cancer. Second, we will use machine-learning algorithms for the extraction of signatures to predict whether TILs grow well in culture, require and respond to metabolic interventions, or cannot be revitalized and do not grow at all. To deal with non-growing T cells, we aim at establishing a microfluidics-based workflow to graft the entire T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire from thousands of non-growing TILs onto fast growing Jurkat cells. After selecting Jurkat cells that recognize neoantigens, their TCRs will be expressed on naïve T cells obtained from the patient’s blood that are fit and suitable for ACT. This project will contribute to a better understanding of the T cell response to liver cancer and help increasing the success of personalized ACTs for solid tumors.",Roger Geiger,Institute for Research in Biomedicine,Switzerland,-,803150,ERC-2018-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS7 - Prevention, Diagnosis & Treatment of Human Diseases",2018,43466,45291,1406250,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/803150,Institute for Research in Biomedicine
Horizon 2020,TALE,Therapeutic Allele Engineering: A novel technology for cell therapy,"We are currently witnessing a revolution in cell therapies that are routed in decades of basic research in genetics, cell biology and immunology. A deep understanding of mammalian, and in particular immune, cells is currently being translated into highly efficient cell-based therapeutics. Technologic breakthroughs in genetic and genome engineering are further fueling the generation of customized, high precision therapies that are based on cells as “smart drugs”. For instance, reprogramming immune killer cells to recognize B cell leukemias resulted in unprecedented clinical responses in treatment-resistant and relapsed patients. However, currently only very few, highly selected patients benefit from these developments. A fundamental problem of today’s cell therapies is that transferred cells cannot be distinguished from host cells. We have developed “allele engineering”, a new technology that solves this challenge. Here, we outline how allele engineering will improve the safety and efficacy of cell therapies. We will 1) generate a non-viral, DNA-free safety/shielding switch 2) develop a radically new curative approach to acute myeloid leukemia 3) rationally design a safe allele engineering solution for human therapy and 4) use allele engineering as a curative therapy of scurfy syndrome, a lethal monogenic autoimmune disease.

Horizon 2020,CAN-IT-BARRIERS,Disruption of systemic and microenvironmental barriers  to immunotherapy of antigenic tumors,"The frontier in cancer therapy of orchestrating the immune system to attack tumors is producing unprecedented survival benefit in some patients. The corollary is lack of efficacy both in ostensibly responsive tumor types as well as others that are mostly non-responsive. The basis lies in pre-existing and adaptive resistance mechanisms that circumvent induction of tumor-reactive cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) capable of infiltrating solid tumors and eliminating cancer cells. A priori, cancers induced by expression of human papillomavirus oncogenes should be responsive to immunotherapy: these cancers encode immunogenic neo-antigens – the oncoproteins E6/7 – necessary for their manifestation. Rather, such tumors are poorly responsive to immunotherapies. Results from my lab and others using mouse models of HPV-induced cancer have established an actionable hypothesis:  during tumorigenesis, such tumors erect multiple barriers to the induction, infiltration, and killing of cancer cells by tumor antigen-reactive CTLs. These include overarching systemic antigen-nonspecific immunosuppression mediated by expanded populations of myeloid cells in spleen and lymph nodes, complemented by immune response-impairing barriers operative in the tumor microenvironment. A spectrum of models will probe these barriers, genetically and pharmacologically, establishing their functional importance, alone and in concert. A major focus will be on how oncogene-expressing keratinocytes elicit a marked expansion of immunosuppressive myeloid cells in spleen and lymph nodes, and how these myeloid cells in turn inhibit development and activation of CD8 T cells and antigen-presenting dendritic cells.  Then we’ll assess the therapeutic potential of barrier-breaking strategies combined with immuno-stimulatory modalities.  This project will deliver new knowledge about multi-faceted barriers to immunotherapy in these refractory cancers, helping lay the groundwork for efficacious immunotherapy.",Douglas Hanahan,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,834947,ERC-2018-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS7 - Prevention, Diagnosis & Treatment of Human Diseases",2018,43831,45657,2500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/834947,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,CLLCLONE,"Harnessing clonal evolution in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
","Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in adults, is addicted of interactions with the microenvironment. The B-cell receptor (BCR) is one of the most important surface molecules that CLL cells use to gain oncogenic signals from the microenvironment. The critical role of BCR signaling for the pathogenesis of CLL is supported by the therapeutic success of ibrutinib, a targeted agent that disrupts the BCR pathway. Beside microenvironment-promoted oncogenic signals, the biology of CLL is also driven by molecular lesions and clonal evolution, that mark CLL progression and treatment resistance. The interconnection between microenvironment-promoted oncogenic signals and clonal evolution has been postulated in CLL but never proven because of the lack of suitable ex vivo models. Ibrutinib allows the unprecedented opportunity of assessing the contribution of cell signaling to cancer clonal evolution directly in vivo in patients. The project working hypothesis is that mutation- and selection-driven clonal evolution is promoted by microenvironment-induced signals, including those propagated from the BCR. According to this hypothesis: i) BCR signaling inhibition due to ibrutinib should stop clonal evolution; while ii) acquisition of by-pass mechanisms that keep ongoing signaling should promote mutation and selection despite BCR inhibition, thus favoring CLL clonal evolution and ibrutinib resistance. In this scenario, the combination of ibrutinib with drugs that overcome by-pass mechanisms could prevent clonal evolution, thus improving treatment efficacy and patient outcome. In order to address our working hypothesis, we will take advantage of clinical trial and co-clinical trial samples to monitor signaling and clonal evolution under ibrutinib and ibrutinib-based combination treatments.",Davide Rossi,Foundation for the Research and Cure of Lymphoma in Ticino,Switzerland,-,772051,ERC-2017-COG,Consolidator Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS7 - Prevention, Diagnosis & Treatment of Human Diseases",2017,43282,45107,1940000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/772051,Foundation for the Research and Cure of Lymphoma in Ticino
Horizon 2020,CARDEVOL,Evolutionary consequences of novel plant defences,"Plant chemical defences play a central role in mediating interactions between plants and their enemies. Phytochemical diversity may be advantageous to reduce herbivore pressure, and plants commonly produce vast numbers of chemicals. However, the diversity of functional classes of defensive chemicals is often more limited and subject to strong phylogenetic constraints. Such functional conservatism may accelerate the evolution of tolerance in specialized herbivores, resulting in plant-herbivore systems dominated by specialists resistant to host plant defences. This presents major challenges for the study of phytochemically-mediated coevolution, as most systems lack the early stages of coevolutionary interactions that are crucially important to predict evolutionary trajectories. Occasionally however, the gain of functionally novel traits allows plants to escape their coevolved herbivores. The genus Erysimum (Brassicaceae) has gained functionally novel cardenolides in addition to ancestral glucosinolate defences, allowing it to escape several glucosinolate-adapted specialists. Making use of the unique natural and emerging molecular resources in this system, CARDEVOL will comprehensively evaluate the ecological, physiological, and evolutionary consequences of novel defences for the plant and its herbivores. CARDEVOL has four main objectives: 1) to characterize the full extent of natural variation in defence of a widespread Erysimum species and to identify environmental drivers; 2) to manipulate both defences and evaluate their contributions to plant fitness in the field; 3) to evaluate tolerance and resistance mechanisms of a community of non-adapted specialist herbivores towards the new defence; and 4), to evolve herbivores under artificial selection for increased resistance. CARDEVOL thus aims at pushing the boundaries of chemical ecology and transforming the field by elucidating the causes and consequences of phytochemical diversification involving gains of function.",Tobias Züst,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,950319,ERC-2020-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS8 - Environmental Biology, Ecology & Evolution",2020,44228,46053,1500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/950319,University of Zurich

High-throughput sequencing technologies have revolutionized microbial community studies and changed our view of the diversity of life. In order to understand how microbes function and interact with other cells, however, sequencing- and cultivation-based techniques must be complemented with experiments that elucidate phenotypes in situ at the single-cell level. 

In Aim 1, we will develop cryoET methods for their application to problems in microbial ecology. We will resolve technical challenges of cryoET application to complex environmental samples, including aspects of sample preparation, data collection, data analysis and data integration.

In Aim 2, we will apply the new methods to outstanding biological questions to advance our understanding of cell-cell interactions. We will study the role of unique bacterial tubulins in a bacterium-ciliate symbiosis, aspects of multicellularity in magnetotactic bacteria, and the diversity and roles of bacterial contractile injection systems.

This project resides at the interface of structural biology/biophysics and environmental/evolutionary biology. We will leverage the power of cryoET to generate three-dimensional images of cells in a frozen-hydrated life-like state, and at macromolecular resolution.

Horizon 2020,ECOSTRAT,Interrogating the diversity of gut colonization strategies in multidrug-resistant E. coli to deduce robust competitive exclusion-based treatments,"The rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria limits the options to treat critically ill patients.  In 2015, Escherichia coli producing Extended Spectrum β-Lactamases (ESBL) were the leading cause of death attributable to antibiotic resistant bacteria in Europe. The failure to address these infections using standard antibiotherapy calls for better understanding of how these bacteria evolve in order to develop new treatments.
Presence of resistance and virulence genes correlates with high prevalence in ESBL clones. Since the intestinal tract of mammals represents a major ecological niche for E. coli, gut colonization ability must have predisposed certain clones to evolutionary success during the antibiotic era. In particular, competition against the gut microbiota should select for colonization factors that predate the acquisition of resistance.
To test this hypothesis, we will compare strategies for gut colonization in ESBL clones of different prevalence in absence of antibiotics. Using mice, we will be able to modulate selective pressures exerted by the intestinal microbiota. We will compare gut colonization factors in ESBL clones by performing parallel high-throughput genetic screening in conventional mice (aim 1). We will analyze adaptability and the stability of resistance and virulence genes during long-term colonization (aim 2). Subsequent competitions in gnotobiotic mice harboring permissive microbiota will allow us to deduce functions needed for colonization in the presence of a competitive microbiota. In aim 3, we will measure the impact of competitors transmitted from cohabitant to infected mice on the duration of ESBL E. coli carriage and assess potential synergies with the adaptive immunity in vaccinated hosts.
Overall, we will unravel with unprecedented depth the general principles of intestinal colonization in ESBL E. coli, shed new light on the global success of prevalent clones and conceptualize robust antibiotic-free competition-based treatments.

Horizon 2020,MyGardenOfTrees,A range-wide transplant experiment using participatory science and genomic prediction to assess local adaptation in forest trees,"How organisms adapt to their environments is the most fundamental question in evolutionary biology and is of utmost importance given climate change threats. Identifying key traits involved in adaptations and understanding how they interact with each other, and with the environment, is a particularly urgent task for foundation and resource-production species, such as forest trees. Existing experiments assessing local adaptation lack scalability and predictability in natural environments, especially at the species range margins. Landscape genomics studies could reveal adaptive loci across environmental gradients, but they are hindered by the assumptions of a neutral model and the highly polygenic nature of most traits. To address these shortcomings, I will conduct a species range-wide transplant experiment using participatory science and genomics to (i) reveal major patterns and drivers of adaptation and (ii) to build a predictive model for selecting optimal seed sources for a given location that accounts for gene-environment interactions and demography. I will develop a participatory network of foresters as well as ordinary citizens, who will establish a large number (>2500) of micro gardens (4 to 36 m2). Seeds source populations of Fagus sylvatica and Abies alba, and their sister species, will be selected from across their ranges. To evaluate plant performance in novel climate conditions, garden locations will also cover locations beyond the species' current distribution range. Early survival and growth traits, which are under the highest selection pressure in trees, will be monitored and analyzed herein. An unprecedented nearly full factorial design transplant data set will be obtained using a genomic prediction (GP) model that exploits the genetic similarity between populations and the environmental similarity between garden locations.

Horizon 2020,PhyCogy,From Foundations of Phylodynamics to New Applications in Cell Biology,"How did the current biodiversity emerge? How does a single fertilised egg develop into a functioning organism? Which factors govern the spread of a pathogen during an epidemic? The answers to these questions depend on the underlying population dynamic processes, i.e. the replication and change of individuals. I will establish fundamental rules of population dynamic processes within the project PhyCogy.

I hypothesize that applying statistical tools to phylogenetic trees uncovers these fundamental rules. Such statistical phylodynamic inference is possible since trees display replication events together with the genotypes and phenotypes of individuals. However, the phylodynamic technique has only been widely applied in the disciplines of macroevolution and epidemiology.

In Part I of the PhyCogy project, I will lay generalizable mathematical, statistical, and computational foundations for phylodynamics. In particular, I will formulate, explore, and apply novel phylodynamic models that are appropriate for neutral as well as selective or developmental processes. I will then investigate whether the newly proposed phylodynamic models allow us to reconcile competing theories within macroevolution and real-time epidemiology.

In Part II, the proposed phylodynamic models are then used to investigate the development of multicellular organisms. I will quantify brain development based on human stem-cell derived organoids as well as zebrafish using single cell data obtained both via CRISPR-Cas9-based lineage tracing and transcriptome sequencing. 

The project PhyCogy establishes a phylodynamic foundation, quantifying core population dynamic processes in macroevolution, epidemiology, and development. Importantly, the generalizability of the framework allows for future application across biological scales, leading to the rules of population dynamic processes in disciplines as diverse as microbiology, virology, ecology, immunology, or cancer.",Tanja Stadler,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,101001077,ERC-2020-COG,Consolidator Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS8 - Environmental Biology, Ecology & Evolution",2020,44348,46173,1999540,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101001077,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,ECOLBEH,The Ecology of Collective Behaviour,"The evolutionary transition from solitary to group living has fundamentally changed how organisms interact with their environment. However, to reap the rewards of group living, from collective intelligence to predator avoidance, group members must maintain cohesion by making collective decisions. Theory suggests that individuals’ ability to influence collective decisions could be determined by a range of factors, including their state, social role, relationships with other group members, the composition of their social group, and the physical environment. Although these factors could all interact, most empirical studies have investigated them in isolation. The aim of this project is to take a ‘whole-system’ approach by quantifying (1) how individual-level factors determine leadership, (2) how movement decisions are modulated by long-term social and genetic relationships among group members, and (3) whether the mechanisms by which groups reach consensus are resilient to rapid environmental change. This research program will add unprecedented ecological validity and replication to the field of collective decision making. I will leverage state-of-the-art technology and develop novel methods to simultaneously collect and analyse multi-scale data in a wild population of highly social birds. These data include the movement of individuals within and between groups (high-resolution GPS), social interactions (direct observations), kinship (whole-genome sequencing), physiology (heart rate), and environmental conditions (drone-based mapping). The analytical methods I will develop (e.g. multi-layered dynamic social network analysis) will provide new tools for the research community, while integrating these unique data across replicated groups and over multiple generations, the project will bring new depth to the field.

Horizon 2020,No Sex No Conflict,Evolutionary Consequences of Arrested Genomic Conflict in Asexual Species,"Genomic conflicts are major drivers of evolutionary innovation and play an increasingly recognized role in human disease. Intra-genomic conflicts arise because self-promoting elements such as driving centromeres or transposable elements (TEs) can spread in a population without increasing the fitness of their carriers. Inter-genomic conflicts arise when genes have opposite fitness effects in different carriers, as is the case for genes underlying traits with distinct optimal values in males and females. Here I propose to use asexual species as a novel system to studying intra- and inter-genomic conflicts. Because there is no recombination or segregation under asexual reproduction, intra-genomic conflict disappears as the interests of all genetic elements become aligned with those of their host. This allows us to test the predictions that intra-genomic conflict drives the evolution of TE virulence, centromeres, and centromere-binding proteins. Furthermore, because asexual species are comprised of only females, male phenotypes are no longer under selection and sexual conflict over optimal trait values therefore disappears. This proposal leverages the replicated loss of conflicts in independently evolved asexual lineages of Timema stick insects to identify conflict driven aspects of genomic and phenotypic evolution in sexual species. Because Timema have an XX:XO sex determination system, males can be recovered from asexual lineages via X-chromosome losses. This allows for the study of male reproductive traits, sexual dimorphism and sex-biased gene expression in species where selection has been acting solely on females for prolonged time periods, and for the identification of traits and biological processes subject to sexual conflict. By combining phenotypic, experimental and next-generation sequencing approaches, we will generate a cohesive understanding of how intra- and inter-genomic conflict shape phenotype and genome evolution.",Tanja Schwander,University of Lausanne,Switzerland,-,864672,ERC-2019-COG,Consolidator Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS8 - Environmental Biology, Ecology & Evolution",2019,43922,45930,1989769,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/864672,University of Lausanne
Horizon 2020,ECOEVODRTB,Linking within-host and between-host evolution of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the etiologic agent of tuberculosis (TB), is the main cause of human deaths due to infection in general, and to antimicrobial resistance in particular. Little is known on the within-host evolution of Mtb. Theory predicts that in chronic infections like TB, short-sighted evolution operates in the light of a trade-off between virulence and transmission. This trade-off is particularly relevant in the context of drug resistance, given the fitness costs of resistance. However, the role of short-sighted evolution in TB has never been explored empirically. Theory and model systems further predict that phenotypic drug tolerance facilitates the emergence of drug resistance, but the relevance of phenotypic drug tolerance for drug resistance evolution in the clinic has not been established for TB or any other bacterial disease. To address these and related questions, I propose to build on my recent work on the transmission of drug-resistant Mtb with a new focus on the within-patient evolution of drug-resistant Mtb and its link to between-patient evolution during transmission.
Specifically, I shall:
1) Define the genomic characteristics and evolutionary forces shaping multidrug-resistant Mtb populations in individual patients over time and across different body compartments;
2) Compare the genomic and phenotypic properties of multidrug-resistant Mtb populations in individual patients to those circulating within the corresponding patient population;
3) Determine the effect of suboptimal patient treatment and phenotypic drug tolerance on drug resistance evolution in Mtb inside patients.

Horizon 2020,SYMBIOSES,Novel Symbioses,"The introduction of new functionalities into cells is a challenge, but it offers tremendous opportunities. While some traits may be acquired through lateral gene transfer and be immediately operational, others are complex and require comprehensive rewiring of the host cell due to lack of orthogonality. A powerful strategy used by cells to acquire new properties is the incorporation of other dedicated cells as endosymbionts that may eventually become organelles in the course of evolution, the most prominent example being the origin of the mitochondrion and chloroplast, both of which transformed life as we know it. SYMBIOSES is an interdisciplinary project that will explore endosymbioses in an experimental approach to introduce metabolic traits as cellular compartments. In the first phase of the project, we will (i) design novel cell-in-cell merger couples composed of a unicellular eukaryote as the host and a prokaryote as the designated endosymbiont and use modelling to optimize the metabolic pre-requisites for cooperation and ultimately endosymbioses, (ii) establish cooperating co-cultures of cells that depend on each other metabolically, and (iii) develop nanotechnology approaches to incorporate cells into other cells. In the second phase of the project, we will deliver cells into cells to establish endosymbioses as operating units. We will then optimize endosymbioses by re-engineering and experimental evolution. The approach will unite desired traits consisting of core metabolic processes with a focus on biological nitrogen and carbon fixation.

Horizon 2020,FIT2GO,A toolbox for fitness landscapes in evolution,"A major challenge in evolutionary biology is to quantify the processes and mechanisms by which populations adapt to new environments. In particular, the role of epistasis, which is the genetic-background dependent effect of mutations, and the constraints it imposes on adaptation, has been contentious for decades. This question can be approached using the concept of a fitness landscape: a map of genotypes or phenotypes to fitness, which dictates the dynamics and the possible paths towards increased reproductive success. This analogy has inspired a large body of theoretical work, in which various models of fitness landscapes have been proposed and analysed. Only recently, novel experimental approaches and advances in sequencing technologies have provided us with large empirical fitness landscapes at impressive resolution, which call for the evaluation of the related theory.The aim of this proposal is to build on the theory of fitness landscapes to quantify epistasis across levels of biological organization and across environments, and to study its impact on the population genetics of adaptation and hybridization. Each work package involves classical theoretical modelling, statistical inference and method development, and data analysis and interpretation; a combination of approaches for which my research group has strong expertise. In addition, we will perform experimental evolution in Escherichia coli and influenza to test hypotheses related to the change of fitness effects across environments, and to adaptation by means of highly epistatic mutations. We will specifically apply our methods to evaluate the potential for predicting routes to drug resistance in pathogens. The long-term goal lies in the development of a modeling and inference framework that utilizes fitness landscape theory to infer the ecological history of a genome, which may ultimately allow for a prediction of its future adaptive potential.",Claudia Bank,University of Bern,Switzerland,-,804569,ERC-2018-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),"LS8 - Environmental Biology, Ecology & Evolution",2018,43525,45535,1366250,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/804569,University of Berne
Horizon 2020,EVOMORPHYS,Identifying how Evolution exploits physical properties of tissues to generate the complexity and diversity of Life,"My project focuses on answering one fundamental question: what are the drivers of Life’s morphological complexity and diversity? I claim that this question can only be addressed by a Newtonian-Darwinian synthesis that considers how Evolution exploits the physical properties of living matter. I will investigate how the evolutionary process explores the phase space of possible interactions between physical (mechanics, reaction-diffusion) and biological (cell signalling, proliferation, migration) processes and generates configurations that compute functional phenotypes. In particular, I will combine experiments in biology and physics, as well as mathematical models and Artificial-Life (ALife) numerical simulations. The latter will be based on physics’ first principles, symmetry-breaking processes and a genetic algorithm. First, I will investigate how geometry affects signalling by (i) imaging the embryonic development of colour patterns and skin geometries of multiple squamate species with various scale-to-colour pattern correspondences, (ii) generating CRISPR/Cas9 scaleless mutants in two lizard species to study the effect of skin 3D geometry on colour patterning, and (iii) performing ALife experiments to explore how the evolutionary process can modify signalling events and exploit geometry to generate new patterns. Second, I will analyse how growth can affect geometry by (i) performing in-silico experiments where coupling between growth and morphogenesis is systematically explored and (ii) evaluating how much the in-silico model captures morphologies generated with physics laboratory experiments using 3D layered polymeric gels. Third, I will build a Newtonian-Darwinian framework by coupling geometry, signalling, growth and mechanics in extensive open-ended ALife experiments.

Horizon 2020,Ecol of interactions,Developing the predictive ecology of plant-animal interactions across space and time,"In the face of the alarming pace of recent environmental change we lack the tools to accurately predict how biodiversity and ecosystem services will respond. One key gap in knowledge that limits our predictive ability is uncertainty concerning how the biotic interactions will change. Developing a predictive science of species interactions requires integrating evolutionary, biogeographic and ecological mechanisms acting at different spatial and temporal scales. We will use a hierarchical cross-scale approach, combining phylogeography, network ecology, statistical modelling and experiments, to disentangle the mechanisms governing species richness and mutualistic interactions in tropical hummingbirds and their food plants.  Hummingbirds and their food plants are an excellent model system because they are highly diverse, highly specialized, and logistically feasible to study. Our objectives are to (1) evaluate the influence of factors, such as trait-matching, environmental conditions and relatedness, on network structure; (2) quantify how and why interaction beta-diversity (i.e., reflecting the change in both species composition, and in interacting partners) changes across elevation gradients in each of three biogeographic regions with distinct evolutionary histories (mountain regions in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Brazil); (3) evaluate the importance of multiple factors, such as trait-matching, environmental conditions, relatedness and abundance, on species interactions and network structure; and (4) develop a predictive model of species interactions and evaluate its performance using cross-validation and experimentation. Together, these tasks will provide new insight into one of the central enigmas in ecology, namely, why species diversity and its interaction architecture change across space and time.

So far, we largely lack tools to precisely monitor the temporal and spatial profile of neurochemical signaling in behaving animals. The ability to do this is a prerequisite for understanding the critical functions of these molecules in both health and disease. 
OPTONEUROCHEM is a bold and transformative project that will develop a new breed of genetically encoded sensors to enable real-time and highly-specific functional imaging of neurochemicals at unprecedented resolution in awake behaving animals. This project is geared towards creating innovative tools that will transform the current biotechnological landscape. 
I will first engineer novel red-shifted sensors for monoamines and apply them in multiplex and optoacoustic imaging experiments (Objective 1). I will then develop sensors for neuropeptides based on previously unexplored receptor subtypes. These will be validated in increasingly complex biological systems and utilized for monitoring the task-specific dynamics of endogenous neuropeptides in multiple brain regions of awake behaving mice (Objective 2). Finally, I will leverage on novel protein scaffolds to engineer the first ultrasensitive probes for steroid hormones and explore their application to in vivo imaging (Objective 3). This high-risk high-reward project combines state-of-the-art cross-disciplinary techniques, ranging from protein engineering and optogenetics, to animal behavior, and in vivo fluorescence and optoacoustic imaging.

Horizon 2020,PRENEMA,Mechanisms and Ecological Relevance of Direct Plant Responses to the Third Trophic Level,"Interactions between plants, herbivores and herbivore natural enemies, so-called tritrophic interactions, are important determinants of ecological processes and crop yields. Plants play an important role in tritrophic interactions through their capacity to recognize and respond to herbivores by activating defences. Interestingly, recent work shows that plants also respond directly to natural enemies of herbivores. However, the mechanisms and specificity of these responses are not well understood, and how they influence tritrophic interactions is unknown. PRENEMA aims at characterizing plant responses to the third trophic level as an hitherto overlooked mechanism governing tritrophic interactions. To this end, PRENEMA combines an interdisciplinary approach with a new phenotyping method and a tractable, ecologically and agriculturally relevant, tritrophic model system consisting of maize and its wild ancestor teosinte, the root herbivore Diabrotica balteata and the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora. In a first step, PRENEMA will develop a novel root exometabolome sampling system to simultaneously extract and profile root water-soluble and volatile exudate metabolites. Second, PRENEMA will use this system to characterize changes in maize primary and secondary metabolites upon exposure to entomopathogenic nematodes, and assess the specificity of the responses across different maize and teosinte genotypes and nematode species. Third, a subset of the identified response markers will be used to uncover nematode-associated molecular patterns that are responsible for triggering plant responses. Fourth, the ecological consequences of the plant responses for plants, herbivores and entomopathogenic nematodes will be measured in the greenhouse and the field. The knowledge and technology generated by PRENEMA will help to integrate a new infochemical pathway into tritrophic interactions and will advance the state of the art in belowground chemical ecology.",Christelle Aurelie Maud Robert Ep.

Horizon 2020,Ubl-tool,Development of a chemical biology toolbox for deciphering the ubiquitin code,"Cells respond to external and internal stimuli by dynamically altering the functional status of existing proteins via post-translational modifications (PTMs). One of the most common and versatile PTMs in eukaryotic cells is represented by the covalent attachment of the 76-amino acid protein ubiquitin (Ub) to substrate proteins (ubiquitylation). Substrate modifications range from a single Ub moiety being attached to a protein of interest to complex polymeric Ub chains that can also contain Ub-like proteins (Ubls). Ubiquitylation plays pivotal roles in nearly all aspects of eukaryotic biology and cells dedicate an orchestrated arsenal of enzymes to install (writer proteins), translate (reader proteins) and reverse (eraser proteins) these modifications. The entirety of this complex regulatory system has been coined the Ub code. As many different human diseases, including different types of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases are being linked to dysfunctions in Ubl-related pathways, it is of utmost importance to decipher the Ub code.
Within Ubl-tool we devise a modular and interdisciplinary chemical and synthetic biology platform for studying aspects of ubiquitylation that are challenging or impossible to be addressed by more traditional technologies. We will develop innovative toolkits for generating defined Ubl architectures, including mixed, branched and hybrid Ubl chains and we will apply these tools for identifying novel reader proteins as well as for studying the functional impact of these complex types of modifications on critical cellular processes. Given its fundamental importance in eukaryotic biology, the Ub system has attracted considerable interest and promise as therapeutic target.

Horizon 2020,ROOBABAA,Roots and bacteria: Basis of attraction,"Root microbiome research is motivated by the promise of using growth-promoting, disease-suppressive bacteria as transferable, protective agents in agriculture. Yet, such approaches have not realized their potential as pesticide or fertilizer alternatives. Major obstacle are soil physico-chemical complexity and a staggeringly complex biotic environment. Recent establishments of synthetic communities promise to enable mechanistic understanding of bacterial establishment in the rhizosphere. However, current methods crucially lack in spatial and temporal resolution. The root is an assembly of dynamically evolving, distinct micro-niches for bacterial colonization that I propose to characterize by extensive use of fluorescent microbial marker strains, monitoring of bacterial metabolism and tracing of proliferation and taxis. This is complemented by precise manipulations of root development. The fractal, open-growth of roots must result in rapid changes in nutrient composition and cycles of nutrient abundance and restriction, forcing bacteria to oscillate between different survival strategies. These fundamental aspects of micro-niche formation, change and collapse are largely undescribed, yet central to understand success or failure of bacterial colonization. I propose to visualize and dissect these processes by combining cutting-edge tools for visualization, optical and genetic manipulations of both plant and bacteria. Bacterial model systems will be inserted into defined bacterial culture collections and results from mono-associations will be challenged by soil-based gnotobiotic systems and high-resolution community profiling.

Horizon 2020,TARGET,"Targeting the ""untargetable"" by merging biological and chemical compound libraries","Genome sequencing combined with powerful new research technologies has greatly expanded the number of potential drug targets, offering enormous opportunities to address unmet medical needs. However, for proteins with flat, featureless surfaces or for protein-protein interactions, it has been difficult to impossible to generate ligands based on classical small molecules, hindering their evaluation as targets and the development of drugs.

Herein, we propose a new method and its application for targeting the so-called ""undruggable"" proteins by tapping into a new chemical space, generated by ""merging"" biological and chemical compound libraries. In brief, millions of short cyclic peptides (4–6 amino acids) genetically encoded by phage display (generated with methods we established previously) will be expanded by combinatorially attaching via lateral groups > 1000 different chemical fragments in separate wells of microwell plates. We will develop a strategy that combines the elements of i) automation, ii) liquid transfer by acoustic dispensing, iii) single-round phage display panning, iv) ""phage PCR"" and a primer coding strategy, v) next-generation sequencing (NGS) and vi) computational sequence analysis to perform phage display selections with a library comprising > 1000 non-natural building blocks.

We expect that this technology will deliver ligands to challenging proteins and facilitate their evaluation as drug targets. The ligands are kept small on purpose, below one kDa, and the polarity is limited so that they are more likely to be cell permeable and so they may directly serve as leads for the generation of oral drugs.

Horizon 2020,CRISPRhistory,Reconstructing cellular histories with transcriptional recording,"What are the main differences between a photograph and a video? Photographs record a single point in time and videos continuously record a sequence of events. While the content and interpretation of a photograph is heavily reliant on a single moment in time, a video is not. The tools that scientists have to understand the molecular and cellular world around them are most like film cameras – producing single snapshots to describe dynamic processes. Towards the goal of continuously recording molecular events within cells, my laboratory recently developed ‘transcriptional recording’, an approach that employs CRISPR spacer acquisition from RNA to capture and convert intracellular RNAs into DNA, permanently storing transcriptional information in the DNA of living cells. The newly acquired sequences serve as transcriptional records, which are retrievable via deep sequencing and can be leverage to reconstruct cellular histories. This technology provides an entirely new mode of interrogating dynamic biological and physiological processes and opens up numerous avenues for future work. 

The overall goal of this proposal is to develop transcriptional recording sentinel cells with the capacity to continuously monitor biological and pathological processes within the mammalian gut. To achieve this goal, we will employ a variety of methods that include molecular and cellular biology, synthetic biology, protein engineering, bioinformatics, and mouse models. We will focus our efforts on improving the efficiency of transcriptional recording, combining transcriptional recording with biosensing gene circuits, and demonstrating that transcriptional recording sentinel cells facilitate interrogation of the mammalian gut environment and can be applied as a living diagnostic.

Horizon 2020,LeDNA,Global measure of biodiversity by understanding biogeochemical cycling of environmental DNA in lakes,"The global loss and redistribution of biodiversity is a hallmark of the Anthropocene. Our challenge is to generate information about how altered biodiversity influences ecosystems and use this information to change our impact on the biosphere. To meet this challenge, we must know where species are, how their distributions change in time and why. However, current methods for determining species distributions is expensive, time intensive and hard to do for multiple species and large geographic regions- rendering global trend analysis near infeasible. We therefore need a paradigm shift. I will utilize the biotechnology of the fourth industrial revolution (i.e., inexpensive sequencing and computational power) to empirically change how we sample animal and plant biodiversity to solve the infeasibility problem of tracking multiple species distributions on large spatial scales. I am among the first to show that DNA shed from animals into the environment (‘eDNA’) is transported in rivers (10-12 km) and that it is from aquatic and terrestrial species. Building on these observations, I hypothesize that transported eDNA allows for sampling multiple species on large spatial scales and will test my hypothesis by determining if lakes act as accumulators of eDNA in the landscape by receiving transported eDNA from rivers. Thus, my proposed research will investigate (1) how chemical, physical, and biotic processes cause eDNA decay to understand its transport potential in the environment, (2) how much eDNA from a catchment is transported into a lake, and (3) in a global set of lakes, test whether eDNA measures seasonal turnover of biodiversity for large spatial scales. If lakes accumulate eDNA from their catchments, sampling them will provide the paradigm shift needed to vastly change the cost, speed and geographic scale with which species can be surveyed through time to understand what effect their change has on the biosphere.",Kristy Deiner,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,852621,ERC-2019-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),LS9 - Biotechnology & Biosystems Engineering,2019,43891,45716,1500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/852621,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,FuncMAB,High-throughput single-cell phenotypic analysis of functional antibody repertoires,"Antibodies play an important role ensuring successful protection after vaccination. Upon injection, antigen-binding antibodies are generated to prime the host’s immune system for future encounters with the threat. These responses are highly heterogeneous, with each cell contributing with a single antibody variant to the complexity. Each antibody variant furthermore can recognize a different antigen/epitope with varying specificity and affinity. The immunological function induced is related to those parameters.Depending on the nature of the threat, required protective functional antibodies vary. Therefore, also each vaccination against those threads needs to trigger a specific functional antibody repertoire. Presently, induced functional antibody repertoires have not yet been studied sufficiently, mostly due to the lack of technologies that enable analysing these repertoires with high enough throughput and resolution. Consequently, the mechanisms behind the evolution of these functional repertoires, and the influence of vaccination on these repertoires remain poorly understood.An innovative technology combined with a methodical approach to vaccinations will enable the FuncMab research team to generate data sets needed for the understanding of immunological processes that result in different functional antibody repertoires. Herein, antibodies are analysed on the individual cell level in high-throughput using specific bioassays that target various antibody functions and their biophysical parameters, generating high-resolution data. These functional repertoires are followed over time and evolutionary changes can be linked to introduced vaccine variations, allowing a quantitative approach to study the changes within the repertoires. These in-depth data sets will not only allow understanding interactions between vaccine components and their generated immune responses, but also propels this project to the forefront of creating a new generation of successful vaccines",Klaus Eyer,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,803363,ERC-2018-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),LS9 - Biotechnology & Biosystems Engineering,2018,43497,45322,1500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/803363,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,MechanoIMM,Mechanical Immunoengineering for Enhanced T-cell Immunotherapy,"Cancer immunotherapy harnessing the power of a patient’s immune system to fight cancer is transforming the standard-of-care for cancer. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), a potent immunotherapy that directly infuses a large number of tumour-reactive T cells into patients, has elicited dramatic clinical responses in leukaemia patients recently. However, solid tumour remains a major challenge as tumour employs a number of strategies to prevent effector T cells reaching the tumour sites and attacking cancer by generating a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment. Current strategies are focused on controlling the immune system or the microenvironment using biochemical immunomodulatory reagents to enhance T cell based immunotherapy. Approaches exploiting biophysical and mechanical cues for immunomodulation are largely underappreciated. In this proposal, we aim to exploit mechanical immunoengineering strategies through biophysical cues to develop novel immune related treatments to enhance the efficacy and safety of adoptive T cell therapy for cancer. We will first develop a mechano-training approach to promote the T cell infiltration into tumour tissues using engineered microfluidic system for controlled force application on T cells in a high through-put manner. Second, we will develop a mechano-responsive nanoparticle delivery system to selectively deliver T-cell-supporting drugs in tumour to overcome the immune suppression in the microenvironment and enhance T cell functions for killing cancer. Third, we will develop mechano-inducible cytokine-secreting T cell therapies to augment the efficacy and minimize the toxicity of ACT by exploiting and targeting the difference in tissue stiffness between tumour and healthy tissues. This proposed project will open a new horizon for immunoengineering through biomechanical modulation of immunity for enhanced cancer immunotherapy and provide insight into the fundamentals of mechanotransduction in immune system in health and disease.",Li Tang,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,805337,ERC-2018-STG,Starting Grants,Life Sciences (LS),LS9 - Biotechnology & Biosystems Engineering,2018,43435,45260,1499800,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/805337,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,AGRISCENTS,Scents and sensibility in agriculture: exploiting specificity in herbivore- and pathogen-induced plant volatiles for real-time crop monitoring,"Plants typically release large quantities of volatiles in response to attack by herbivores or pathogens. I may claim to have contributed to various breakthroughs in this research field, including the discovery that the volatile blends induced by different attackers are astonishingly specific, resulting in characteristic, readily distinguishable odour blends. Using maize as our model plant, I wish to take several leaps forward in our understanding of this signal specificity and use this knowledge to develop sensors for the real-time detection of crop pests and diseases. For this, three interconnected work-packages will aim to:• Develop chemical analytical techniques and statistical models to decipher the odorous vocabulary of plants, and to create a complete inventory of “odour-prints” for a wide range of herbivore-plant and pathogen-plant combinations, including simultaneous infestations. • Develop and optimize nano-mechanical sensors for the detection of specific plant volatile mixtures. For this, we will initially adapt a prototype sensor that has been successfully developed for the detection of cancer-related volatiles in human breath. • Genetically manipulate maize plants to release a unique blend of root-produced volatiles upon herbivory. For this, we will engineer gene cassettes that combine recently identified P450 (CYP) genes from poplar with inducible, root-specific promoters from maize. This will result in maize plants that, in response to pest attack, release easy-to-detect aldoximes and nitriles from their roots.In short, by investigating and manipulating the specificity of inducible odour blends we will generate the necessary knowhow to develop a novel odour-detection device. The envisioned sensor technology will permit real-time monitoring of the pests and enable farmers to apply crop protection treatments at the right time and in the right place.",Theodoor Turlings,University of Neuchatel,Switzerland,-,788949,ERC-2017-ADG,Advanced Grants,Life Sciences (LS),LS9 - Biotechnology & Biosystems Engineering,2017,43344,45351,2498086,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/788949,University of Neuchatel
Horizon 2020,ElectroGene,"Electrogenetics – Shaping Electrogenetic Interfaces for Closed-Loop Voltage-Controlled Gene Expression
","Man and man-made electronic systems share the same ecosystem, and yet work radically differently. Human metabolism uses ion gradients across insulated membranes to simultaneously process slow analog chemical reactions and communicate information in multicellular systems via soluble/volatile molecular signals. By contrast, electronic systems use multicore central processing units to control the flow of electrons through insulated metal wires with gigahertz frequency and communicate information across networks via wired/wireless connections. With the advent of the internet of things, networks of interconnected electronic devices will reach the processing complexity of living systems, yet they remain largely incompatible with biological systems. Wearable electronics can profile physical parameters such as steps and heartbeat, and Google’s proposal to develop glucose-monitoring contact lenses has triggered a wave of interest in harnessing the full potential of bioelectronics for medical applications. Yet this vision remains limited to diagnostics. Capitalizing on our mind-controlled and smartphone-adjustable optogenetic drug-dosing devices, ElectroGene will establish the foundations of electrogenetics, the science of creating electro-genetic interfaces that enable direct two-way communication between electronic devices and living cells. ElectroGene consists of three pillars, (i) voltage-triggered gene expression, (ii) genetically programmed electronics and (iii) wireless-powered implants providing closed-loop bioelectronic control, which allow real-time monitoring of metabolic conditions (diagnosis), enable remote-controlled production and dosing of protein therapeutics by implanted designer cells (treatment), and manage closed-loop control between cells and electronics, thus linking diagnosis and therapy to block disease onset (prevention).

Horizon 2020,StableIF,"Stable interfaces: phase transitions, minimal surfaces, and free boundaries","One of the main drivers of development for the theory of nonlinear elliptic PDE during the second half of the XX century has been the mathematical analysis of physical models for “inter- faces”. Depending on the specific model, these “interfaces” are called minimal surfaces, phase transitions, free boundaries, etc. These models are very important in applications and, due to their strong geometric content and the interdisciplinary methods required for their study, also from a “pure mathematics” perspective.  One of the simplest semilinear PDE exhibiting an interface is the classical Allen-Cahn equation. Originally proposed as a model for metal alloys, it gained mathematical notoriety due to its deep connection with the minimal surface equation and many other important PDE. It is very related to the Cahn-Hiliard equation (phase separation in binary fluids), to the Peierls-Nabarro equation (crystal dislocations), and to the Ginzburg-Landau theory (phase transitions, super-conductivity). In addition, it has similarities with other important models such as Bernoulli’s free boundary problem (flame propagation and shape optimization) or the Eriksen-Leslie system (liquid crystals).  In the last four decades, outstanding works led to a very deep understanding of the structure of (absolute) energy minimizers for most of the previous models. Still, up to very few exceptions, almost nothing is known today on the structure of stable solutions —i.e. (roughly speaking) minimizers with respect to sufficiently small perturbations. Since stable solutions are “the ones observable in Nature”, their understanding is a fundamental question. Even though it is a very challenging mathematical problem, all the new analysis tools developed in the last decades plus some recent progress give us now an excellent opportunity to address it. In three words, the very ambitious goal of this ERC project is to “understand stable interfaces”.",Joaquim Serra Montoli,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,948029,ERC-2020-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE1 - Mathematics,2020,44197,46265,1398125,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/948029,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,CriSP,Critical and supercritical percolation,"Percolation studies how independent random input that is spread uniformly on a lattice or in space gives rise to macroscopic structures. This model, initially introduced to understand porosity, has turned out to be central for understanding fundamental features of real-world phenomena, ranging from phase transitions in physical and chemical systems to stability of Boolean functions with respect to perturbations. Over the last sixty years, a number of important mathematical results have been obtained concerning percolation, with ideas, interactions and consequences in mathematical fields such as probability, combinatorics, complex analysis, geometric group theory, planar topology and theoretical computer science.  Highlights include the rigorous derivation of a number of features that are shared with other models from statistical physics: sharpness of phase transitions, renormalization theory, existence of scaling limits and critical exponents, relationship between discrete and continuous descriptions (constructive field theory)...
The story is however incomplete, as some of the most fundamental questions have not yet found a mathematical answer. Two notable examples that motivate the present research proposal are the continuity of the phase transition for Bernoulli percolation in dimension three (does the macroscopic structure appear continuously?) and the universality of planar percolation (are the macroscopic features of critical percolation in two dimensions independent of the microscopic model under consideration?). 
In light of very recent progress, we propose here a list of interrelated projects, with the global aim of developing new tools that should enable us to make progress towards these two open problems. The impact of this study would go beyond the percolation or statistical physics community, as we aim to provide a clean and thorough understanding of some key concepts and phenomena, that would find natural applications in other disciplines.",Vincent Tassion,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,851565,ERC-2019-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE1 - Mathematics,2019,44075,46446,1479675,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/851565,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,MODSTABVAR,Moduli spaces of stable varieties and applications,"Stable varieties, originally introduced by Kollár and Shepherd-Barron, are higher dimensional generalizations of the algebro-geometric notion of stable curves from many perspectives. Their partially conjectural moduli space classifies smooth projective varieties of general type up to birational equivalence, and it also provides a projective compactification for this classifying space. The latter is essential for applying algebraic geometry to the moduli space itself. Furthermore, over the complex numbers, stable varieties can be also defined surprisingly as the projective varieties admitting a negative curvature (singular) Kähler-Einstein metric by the work of Berman and Guenancia, or as the canonically polarized K-stable varieties by Odaka. The fundamental objective of the project is to construct the coarse moduli space of stable surfaces with fixed volume over the integers (possibly excluding finitely many primes, not depending on the volume). In particular this involves showing the Minimal Model Program for 3-folds that are projective over a 1 dimensional mixed characteristic base. The main motivations are applications to the general algebraic geometry and arithmetic of higher dimensional varieties.The above fundamental goal is also an incarnation of Grothendieck's philosophy that algebraic geometry statements should be proved in a relative setting. This was implemented right at the beginning for stable curves, but it has not been possible to attain for stable varieties of higher dimensions, due to the lack of technology. Hence, the project aims to establish new technology in mixed and positive characteristic geometry based on recent developments, such as modern Minimal Model Program, the vanishings given by balanced big Cohen-Macaulay algebras (the existence of which was shown by André using Scholze's perfectoid theory), trace method for lifting sections, p-torsion cohomology killing via alterations (by Bhatt), torsor method on singular varieties, etc.",Zsolt Patakfalvi,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,804334,ERC-2018-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE1 - Mathematics,2018,43891,45900,1201370,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/804334,EPF Lausanne

More precisely, we focus on the following three thrusts, which share many combinatorial features:- Integer programming with bounded subdeterminants.- Expressive power of mixed-integer linear formulations.- The matroid secretary conjecture, a key online selection problem.Recent significant progress, in which the PI played a central role, combined with new ideas, give hope to obtain breakthrough results in these fields. Many of the questions we consider are long-standing open problems in their respective area, and any progress is thus likely to be a significant contribution to Mathematical Optimization and Theoretical Computer Science.

Horizon 2020,CLaQS,Correlations in Large Quantum Systems,"This project is devoted to the mathematical analysis of important physical properties of many-body quantum systems. We will be interested in properties of the ground state and low-energy excitations but also of non-equilibrium dynamics. We are going to consider systems with different statistics and in different regimes. The questions we are going to address have a common aspect: correlations among particles play a crucial role. Our main goal consists in developing new tools that allow us to correctly describe many-body correlations and to understand their effects.   The starting point of our proposal are ideas and techniques that have been introduced in a series of papers establishing the validity of Bogoliubov theory for Bose gases in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime, and in a recent preprint showing how (bosonic) Bogoliubov theory can also be used to study the correlation energy of Fermi gases. In this project, we plan to develop these techniques further and to apply them to new contexts. We believe they have the potential to approach some fundamental open problem in mathematical physics.   Among our most ambitious objectives, we include the proof of the Lee-Huang-Yang formula for the energy of dilute Bose gases and of the corresponding Huang-Yang formula for dilute Fermi gases, as well as the derivation of the Gell-Mann--Brueckner expression for the correlation energy of a high density Fermi system.

Horizon 2020,COMANFLO,Computation and analysis of statistical solutions of fluid flow,"Entropy (admissible) weak solutions are widely considered to be the standard solution framework for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws and incompressible Euler equations. However, the lack of global existence results in several space dimensions, the recent demonstration of non-uniqueness of these solutions and computations showing the lack of convergence of state of the art numerical methods to them, have reinforced the need to seek alternative solution paradigms. Although one can show that numerical approximations of these nonlinear PDEs converge to measure-valued solutions i.e Young measures, these solutions are not unique and we need to constrain them further. Statistical solutions i.e, time-parametrized probability measures on spaces of integrable functions, are a promising framework in this regard as they can be characterized as a measure-valued solution that also contains information about all possible multi-point spatial correlations. So far, well-posedness of statistical solutions has been shown only in the case of scalar conservation laws.The main aim of the proposed project is to analyze statistical solutions of systems of conservation laws and incompressible Euler equations and to design efficient numerical approximations for them. We aim to prove global existence of statistical solutions in several space dimensions, by showing convergence of these numerical approximations, and to identify suitable additional admissibility criteria for statistical solutions that can ensure uniqueness. We will use these numerical methods to compute statistical quantities of interest and relate them to existing theories (and observations) for unstable and turbulent fluid flows.

Horizon 2020,CausalStats,"Statistics, Prediction and Causality for Large-Scale Data","Understanding cause-effect relationships between variables is of great interest in many fields of science. However, causal inference from data is much more ambitious and difficult than inferring (undirected) measures of association such as correlations, partial correlations or multivariate regression coefficients, mainly because of fundamental identifiabilityproblems. A main objective of the proposal is to exploit advantages from large-scale heterogeneous data for causal inference where heterogeneity arises from different experimental conditions or different unknown sub-populations. A key idea is to consider invariance or stability across different experimental conditions of certain conditional probability distributions: the invariants correspond on the one hand to (properly defined) causal variables which are of main interest in causality; andon the other hand, they correspond to the features for constructing powerful predictions for new scenarios which are unobserved in the data (new probability distributions). This opens novel perspectives: causal inferencecan be phrased as a prediction problem of a certain kind, and vice versa, new prediction methods which work well across different scenarios (unobserved in the data) should be based on or regularized towards causal variables. Fundamental identifiability limits will become weaker with increased degree of heterogeneity, as we expect in large-scale data. The topic is essentially unexplored, yet it opens new avenues for causal inference, structural equation and graphical modeling, and robust prediction based on large-scale complex data. We will develop mathematical theory, statistical methodology and efficient algorithms; and we will also work and collaborate on major application problems such as inferring causal effects (i.e., total intervention effects) from gene knock-out or RNA interference perturbation experiments, genome-wide association studies and novel prediction tasks in economics.  ",Peter Lukas Bühlmann,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,786461,ERC-2017-ADG,Advanced Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE1 - Mathematics,2017,43374,45382,2184375,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/786461,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,MACI,"Moduli, Algebraic Cycles, and Invariants","Algebraic geometry is the study of varieties -- the zero sets of polynomial equations in several variables. The subject has a central role in mathematics with connections to number theory, representation theory, and topology. Moduli questions in algebraic geometry concern the behavior of varieties as the coefficients of the defining polynomials vary. At the end of the 20th century, several basic links between the algebraic geometry of moduli spaces and path integrals in quantum field theory were made. The virtual fundamental class plays an essential role in these connections. I propose to study the algebraic cycle theory of basic moduli spaces. The guiding questions are: What are the most important cycles? What is the structure of the algebra of cycles? How can the classes of geometric loci be expressed? The virtual fundamental class and the associated invariants often control the answers. A combination of virtual localization, degeneration, and R-matrix methods together with new ideas from log geometry will be used in the study.Most of the basic moduli spaces in algebraic geometry related to varieties of dimension at most 3 -- including the moduli of curves, the moduli of maps, the moduli of surfaces, and the moduli of sheaves on 3-folds -- will be considered. The current state of the study of the algebraic cycle theory in these cases varies from rather advanced (for the moduli of curves) to much less so (for the moduli of surfaces). There is a range of rich open questions which I will attack: Pixton's conjectures for the moduli of curves, the structure of the ring of Noether-Lefschetz loci for the moduli of K3 surfaces, the holomorphic anomaly equation in Gromov-Witten theory, and conjectures governing descendents for the moduli of sheaves.

Horizon 2020,RESpiReS,"Reconstructing the Effect of Sulfide Respiration on Global Redox State: Insights from Experiments, Observations, and Models","To comprehensively reconstruct the evolution of Earth's climate, atmospheric and seawater chemical compositions, and conditions that favor the proliferation of life, it is critical to constrain all atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) sources and sinks—including their dependencies on underlying environmental and geologic drivers. One major CO2 source and O2 sink remains poorly understood: oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals (e.g., pyrite) on land. In addition to driving Earth's atmospheric composition, pyrite oxidation potentially provides a quantitative proxy for recording past O2 and CO2 levels: the triple-oxygen isotope composition of sulfate. Still, three key questions remain unanswered: (i) what sets the modern-day pyrite oxidation flux, (ii) how has this flux changed over million- to hundred-million-year timescales, and (iii) do geologically preserved sulfate isotopes faithfully record past atmospheric conditions?
Here, I outline a multifaceted research program to answer these questions. This research will develop and apply novel experiments and state-of-the-art geochemical tracers to mechanistically understand pyrite oxidation and resulting sulfate isotope signatures. These results will inform theoretical, kinetic, and numerical models to quantify pyrite oxidation fluxes and atmospheric compositions throughout Earth's history—this combination of techniques is uniquely afforded by my background and expertise. Specifically, this research will: (i) constrain the electrochemical mechanism of pyrite oxidation and its isotopic consequences, (ii) assess which environmental and geologic controlling factors govern pyrite oxidation rates and fluxes, and (iii) determine how secondary redox cycling in the environment overprints sulfate isotope signatures.

Horizon 2020,S-SIM,Sediments and Subduction Interface Mechanics: from micro-scale creep to global plate tectonics,"This project seeks to test the hypothesis that sediment subduction strongly influences both the short-term (seismic) and long-term (million-year) mechanical behavior of the subduction interface. The underlying basis of this hypothesis is the possibility that sediments exhibit fundamentally different frictional and viscous properties than subducted mafic oceanic rocks— specifically that sediments are weaker at all conditions along the plate interface. To test this hypothesis, I have split my approach into three complementary and carefully linked tasks, including Task I. Observations from Exhumed rocks, Task II: Rock Deformation Experiments, and Task III: Numerical Modeling. Task I will involve field geological campaigns in three sites representing different conditions of the plate interface, from shallow to deep. Task II will involve three suites of experiments (closely linked to the field sites) aimed at quantifying the rheological properties of mafic rocks at different pressure-temperature conditions. Task III will involve two types of numerical models: 1) seismo-thermo-mechanical modeling aimed at assessing the influence of heterogeneity on seismic slip behaviors, and 2) large-scale mantle convection modeling aimed at quantifying relationships and feedbacks between subduction interface rheology and plate speeds.

Despite the utmost importance of AMOC for the climate system, there are still many open fundamental questions regarding its physical mechanisms, water mass pathways, and transport or ventilation timescales. TITANICA aims to improve our understanding of AMOC on the basis of a new set of transient radionuclide tracers (129I, 236U, 39Ar and 14C), a quartet that will allow to study and constrain oceanographic processes on timescales of years to millennia. While the combination of the two nuclear reprocessing-derived 129I and 236U will investigate the shorter transport mechanisms (<100 y) of Atlantic waters in the AO and deep-water convection in the SPNA, the natural 39Ar and 14C will provide answers for the ventilation of intermediate and deep waters (>100 y). Newly available techniques will allow the implementation of 39Ar to unprecedented possibilities, closing the time gap between the artificial transient tracers (CFCs, SF6, 129I, 236U) and natural 14C.

Horizon 2020,CLOUDLAB,Using clouds as a natural laboratory to improve precipitation forecast skills,"Clouds have been seeded since the 1940s. Aimed at inducing weather modification, the method uses chemicals to alter the microphysical processes within a cloud to enhance precipitation, suppress hail, or dissipate fog. While the concept of cloud seeding is not new, detailed knowledge about the underlying microphysical processes in clouds is still sparse. CLOUDLAB will tackle this gap by injecting different ice nucleating particle concentrations into supercooled stratus clouds to investigate related microphysical changes, including fundamental aspects of ice formation and growth. To achieve this, the project combines a multi-dimensional approach of targeted cloud seeding with a focus on wintertime stratus clouds in Switzerland, the least dynamic cloud type which best mimics laboratory conditions and allows repetition of field experiments under similar initial conditions. We will inject ice nucleating particles from a seeding drone and perform measurements with ground-based remote sensing, a tethered balloon system equipped with a holographic imager and a measurement drone. Combined with measured meteorological parameters, we aim to understand the impact of cloud inhomogeneities for precipitation initiation via the ice phase. The analysis of our cloud seeding events will be used to validate and improve cloud microphysics schemes in the Swiss weather forecast model in large eddy simulations mode. By coarsening the horizontal resolution to weather forecast mode, the simulations will be extended to include all cloud types where the same microphysical processes are at work to improve precipitation forecast skills in Switzerland. Hence, CLOUDLAB will further the understanding of ice microphysics and precipitation initiation which will also improve climate projections.

Horizon 2020,GLAD,Global Lagrangian Cloud Dynamics,"This project will address fundamental gaps in our understanding of how clouds form, how they interact with the atmospheric flow and how they need to be simulated in weather and climate models. Our inability to improve the representation of clouds and their interactions with the atmospheric flow is the leading cause of the high level of uncertainty associated with projections of future changes in storm tracks, precipitation bands and weather extremes. The representation of clouds in models is poor, largely because clouds are unresolved. Given the potentially significant impacts of projected global warming and the significant benefits of improved weather predictions, it is imperative to improve the representation of cloud-circulation interactions in models. However, how do we acquire the necessary process understanding to close existing knowledge gaps? I propose a fundamentally new perspective on clouds and their control of the large-scale flow leading ultimately to a unique cloud classification system. Instead of studying clouds based on the traditional Eulerian perspective, I suggest analysing cloud-circulation couplings based on the history of air parcels (Lagrangian perspective). A systematic Lagrangian-based investigation of cloud-circulation couplings in ultra-high-resolution simulations is a true novelty and has never been attempted. Based on convection-permitting simulations over a climatological period, which exploit recent advances in supercomputing architectures, the cloud parcels are classified according to their circulation impact and feed into a machine learning algorithm that is trained using the physical processes acting along their pathways. This approach has the potential to drastically improve our mechanistic understanding of how to represent clouds in models and to identify the leading cloud-related processes that control regional to large-scale flow variability, which is one of the Grand Challenges defined by the World Climate Research Programme.",Sebastian Schemm,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,848698,ERC-2019-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE10 - Earth System Science,2019,43831,45657,1493343,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/848698,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,HEATforecast,Dynamical constraints for the predictability of heat waves in current and future climates,"In summer 2018, a devastating heat wave affected the entire Northern Hemisphere. Climate change projections indicate that the severity and frequency of such heat waves will further increase over the next decades. At the same time, models remain unable to predict heat waves at lead times of a few weeks – a crucial planning timescale. The poor prediction skill at timescales of weeks to months is to a large extent due to an incomplete understanding of the underlying physical drivers of heat waves. In particular, the atmospheric fluid dynamics responsible for heat waves and their prediction are not sufficiently understood and tend to be biased in models. The seasonal cycle further modulates the drivers and predictability of heat waves. Climate change projections disagree on the changes in atmospheric dynamics responsible for heat waves. The proposed research takes an unconventional path to address these open questions by building a process-based hierarchy of prediction systems ranging from a dry dynamical core to a prediction system using full physics. This hierarchy approach is novel for prediction systems. By systematically adding processes to the model, the relative contribution of atmospheric dynamics and surface drivers for heat waves and their predictability can be estimated throughout the seasonal cycle and for the projected changes in heat waves with climate change. While solving a fundamental question in atmospheric fluid dynamics, the proposed research aims to significantly extend the warning horizon and thereby minimize the societal consequences for future heat waves, which are expected to increase in frequency but so far remain unpredictable. This project combines the experience and strengths of the PI in atmospheric dynamics, predictability, and their application in a timely manner by increasing the connections between the dynamics and predictability communities that will benefit the study of atmospheric fluid dynamics and predictability beyond heat waves.",Daniela Iris Vera Domeisen,University of Lausanne,Switzerland,-,847456,ERC-2019-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE10 - Earth System Science,2019,43891,46265,1499849,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/847456,University of Lausanne
Horizon 2020,ICED,Impact of climate on mountain denudation,"Mountain ranges evolve in response to tectonic uplift, erosion and climatic change, but decoupling the feedbacks between these processes remains one of the most active debates in Earth Science. Resolving this debate is fundamental for successful projection of Earth’s surface response under a changing climate. The Impact of ClimatE on mountain Denudation remains highly contested because no technique is available to resolve changes in erosion rates over the timescale of glacial-interglacial cycles i.e. 10^3-6 years, a key time range for quantifying the role that silicate weathering and denudation plays in modulating global climatic change. ICED will resolve this debate through establishing time-series of rock erosion over 10^3-6 years, allowing erosion rate changes to be related to specific climatic changes, and specific processes, for the first time. These data will show whether tectonics or climatic feedbacks on surface processes are dominant in determining rates of surface denudation, providing insights into the influence of the lithosphere on global climatic change throughout the Quaternary period (ice age).

The objective of ICED will be achieved through the development and application of recently established thermochronometers based on the luminescence and electron spin resonance of quartz and feldspar minerals. Thermochronometers measure the rate of rock cooling, from which rates of rock exhumation and thus erosion rates can be calculated. Unlike existing methods, the new techniques developed within ICED are capable of resolving changes in erosion over timescales of between 10^3-6 years. Combining these new methods with cosmogenic nuclide data, using numerical models developed within ICED, will allow the generation of high-resolution time-series of erosion. The strategic application of these new techniques to the western European Alps will allow the Impact of ClimatE on mountain Denudation rates to be resolved for the first time.

Horizon 2020,PROMOTING,PROgrade metamorphism MOdeling: a new petrochronological and compuTING framework,"Prograde metamorphism produces large amounts of fluids that have an important role for earthquake generation, arc magmatism, the growth of continental crust and for global geochemical cycles. Despite recent efforts, it remains challenging to recognize and quantify fluid fluxes in natural rocks and to model fluid pathways. The existing petrological modeling techniques are all based on the thermodynamic analysis of single rock types and neglect the chemical changes caused by fluid expulsion and the possible interactions with other rocks. The next frontier in metamorphic petrology is therefore to move our modeling capabilities from an isolated single rock system to an open and multi rock system, in which fluids can flow in, react and flow out. This concept introduces several challenges from the quantification of fluid-rock interactions in natural samples to the integration of aqueous thermodynamics and fluid dynamics in the petrological models. Based on the developments of high-resolution techniques such as quantitative compositional mapping, I have demonstrated that the petrological models can be inverted to quantify prograde metamorphism based on preserved mineral relics that partially re-equilibrated in the presence of fluids. The primary objective of PROMOTING is to develop a brand-new framework for petrological modeling of fluid-rock interactions in different, coupled rock types during prograde metamorphism. The models will be calibrated on two key tectonic settings that shaped Earth: subduction of oceanic crust and differentiation of the continental crust. A cutting-edge petrochronological strategy is required to identify at which conditions and when fluid-rock interactions occurred in natural rocks. The outcomes of this project will not only form the basis for a new generation of models integrating element mobility from rock scale to crustal sections, but they will also bring new constraints to test the validity of the most advanced subduction models.",Pierre Lanari,University of Bern,Switzerland,-,850530,ERC-2019-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE10 - Earth System Science,2019,43983,45991,1993125,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/850530,University of Berne
Horizon 2020,OXYGEN,The redox evolution of arc magmas: from the oxygenation of the Earth’s atmosphere to the genesis of giant hydrothermal ore deposits,"	Arc magmatism at subduction zones is responsible for much of the mass transfer of chemical elements between the Earth’s lower and upper spheres. Arc magmas are significantly more oxidized and richer in volatile elements than other voluminous magma types on Earth. These characteristics promote the genesis of large magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits and potentially also the build-up of the oxygen budget of the Earth’s atmosphere. Despite its great significance, the origin of the higher oxidation state of arc magmas is still one of the most debated questions in petrology. I will combine high-pressure-temperature experiments, field-based studies and computational simulations to obtain quantitative understanding of redox reactions taking place during magma genesis, differentiation and degassing. Subsequently, I will apply this new knowledge to assess if arc magmatism may have been a key to the oxygenation of the Earth’s atmosphere, and to pinpoint the most prospective regions for the generation of giant ore deposits. Most experiments will rely on revolutionary new instrumentation and methodologies, which I have recently developed or will develop as a part of the project. For example, we will determine for the first time the speciation of sulfur in aqueous fluids in situ at magmatic temperatures and upper crustal pressures by using a prototype spectroscopic cell, so that its critical role in redox transfer and ore genesis can be quantified.  Similarly, the field-based studies will employ a new method to constrain the redox evolution of magmas with unparalleled precision, which will be developed experimentally by using a prototype high-pressure apparatus with a unique capability to control redox conditions. In addition, these will also apply a powerful combination of novel and challenging analytical methods including the analysis of Au, Pt, Pd and Re concentrations and S isotope ratios in silicate melt inclusions in minerals to identify the key agents of magma oxidation.",Zoltan Zajacz,University of Geneva,Switzerland,-,864792,ERC-2019-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE10 - Earth System Science,2019,44197,46022,2406972,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/864792,University of Geneva
Horizon 2020,CASSANDRA,Accelerating mass loss of Greenland: firn and the shifting runoff limit,"Meltwater running off the flanks of the Greenland ice sheet contributes roughly 60% to its mass loss, the rest being due to calving. Only meltwater originating from below the elevation of the runoff limit leaves the ice sheet, contributing to mass loss; melt at higher elevations refreezes in the porous firn and does not drive mass loss. Therefore any shift in the runoff limit modifies mass loss and subsequent sea level rise. New evidence shows surface runoff at increasingly high elevations, outpacing the rate at which the equilibrium line elevation rises. This research proposal focuses on the runoff limit as a powerful yet poorly understood modulator of Greenland mass balance. We will track the runoff limit over the full satellite era using two of the largest and oldest remote sensing archives, Landsat and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). We will establish time series of the runoff limit for all regions of Greenland to identify the mechanisms driving fluctuations in the runoff limit. This newly gained process understanding and a wealth of in-situ measurements will then be used to build firn hydrology models capable of simulating runoff and the associated runoff limit over time. Eventually, the firn hydrology models will be applied to reconcile estimates of Greenland past, present and future mass balance. Covering the entire satellite era and all of Greenland, the focus on the runoff limit will constitute a paradigm shift leading to major advance in our understanding of how vulnerable the surface of the ice sheet reacts to climate change and how the changing surface impacts runoff and thus Greenland's role in the global sea level budget.",Horst Machguth,University of Fribourg,Switzerland,-,818994,ERC-2018-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE10 - Earth System Science,2018,43586,45596,1989181,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/818994,University of Fribourg
Horizon 2020,SCrIPT,Stable Chromium Isotopes as a Productivity Tracer,"The overall concept of this proposal is to investigate the main biogeochemical processes modulating spatial and temporal changes in marine export productivity, and assess their role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, both under present conditions and in the geological past. The exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and ocean interior mediated by the oceanic ecosystem is a pivotal mechanism modulating the global carbon cycle, and thus, a substantial driver of the Earth’s climatic evolution. The overarching objective of this research proposal is to develop a novel proxy to trace changes in the global strength of the marine biological carbon pump (BCP) based on stable Chromium (Cr) isotopes. Despite its significance for the global carbon cycle, the BCP is still poorly constrained. This project will explore a tracer that has recently been developed to investigate the rise of atmospheric oxygen in the early history of the Earth and develop it thoroughly through a comprehensive, multidisciplinary calibration program and apply it to the much more subtle redox variations associated with organic matter remineralization in the ocean. The proposed approach includes phytoplankton culture experiments, water-column investigations and sedimentary analysis and will aim at elucidating the mechanisms governing the reduction of Cr and its associated isotopic fractionation. The proxy will subsequently be used to reconstruct export production variability in the past and assess its role in modulating glacial/interglacial climate oscillations. These past changes tended to be much slower than the current, anthropogenic change. Nonetheless, they can help to appraise sensitivities and point toward potentially dominant mechanisms of change. The observations gathered within the framework of this research program will enable refining the evolution of the marine carbon cycle and the rapidly declining buffering capacity of the ocean.",Samuel Jaccard,University of Lausanne,Switzerland,-,819139,ERC-2018-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE10 - Earth System Science,2018,43586,45777,1997625,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/819139,University of Lausanne
Horizon 2020,SPACE TIE,Unifying the three pillars of Geodesy using space ties,"Terrestrial Reference Frames (TRFs) are the basis to which all positions on the Earth’s surface and all satellite orbits in the near Earth space have to refer to. The changes in the Earth's shape, rotation, and gravity field, the so-called ""three pillars"" of geodesy, provide the conceptual and observational basis for the TRFs. For today’s TRF realizations, four space geodetic techniques are combined and linked by co-location sites on the Earth’s surface (“Earth’s shape”) and by common Earth orientation parameters (“Earth rotation”). The third pillar (“Earth’s gravity field”) is today only contributing to the TRF determination via its associated center-of-mass. In SPACE TIE we will pave the way to unify the “three pillars” of Geodesy in future TRF realizations. We propose to use two satellite geodetic techniques, namely Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), to connect them by co-location sites in space. These so-called space ties shall be realized on satellites of the currently existing space infrastructure, as well as on satellites due for launch in the near future. This includes the Medium Earth Orbits (MEO) of the GNSS satellites and, in particular, all satellites in Low Earth Orbits (LEO) with GNSS and SLR co-located on-board. To maximize the sensitivity to the Earth’s gravity field, the ultra-precise inter-satellite ranging between LEO satellites of dedicated gravity missions shall be added as a third satellite geodetic technique. One and the same state-of-the-art space geodetic software package will be used to ensure that standards, background models, and processing strategies are consistently applied across all co-location satellites and measurement techniques.

Horizon 2020,THERA,Timing of Holocene volcanic eruptions and their radiative aerosol forcing,"Volcanic eruptions play a dominant role in driving climate, in ways beyond the established short-term influence on surface air temperatures. In order to mitigate and adapt to the climate effects of future large volcanic eruptions we need to better quantify the risk of these eruptions including 1) the probability of their occurrence and 2) their expected climatic impact. The observational record of the timing of volcanic eruptions, their locations, magnitudes of sulphate aerosol injection is incomplete which limits our understanding of the sensitivity of the Earth system to volcanism and the vulnerability of social and economic systems to the climate impact of past and future eruptions. The primary goal of this proposal is to extract data on the timing, magnitudes and source locations of all major volcanic eruptions occurring during the Holocene (i.e., the past 12,000 years) to answer the questions: What is the likelihood of a stratospheric sulfur injection as large as that from the colossal eruption of Tambora in 1815 to occur somewhere on the globe within the next 100 years? What is the role of effusive eruptions on past, present and future climate? This will be achieved by employing novel, precisely dated, high-time resolution aerosol measurements from bipolar ice-core arrays. New tools will be used to constrain source parameters of the eruptions (location, plume injection height) that control their effects on climate. THERA will constrain recurrence rates for one of the largest global-scale natural hazards, while also assessing linkages between volcanic perturbations and key components of the climate systems (e.g., atmospheric circulation, droughts, ice-sheets and sea-level) through interdisciplinary case studies. As a final goal, THERA will generate global-scale, space-and-time resolved stratospheric aerosol properties for climate models to simulate the volcanic influence on Holocene climate evolution.",Michael Sigl,University of Bern,Switzerland,-,820047,ERC-2018-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE10 - Earth System Science,2018,43525,45535,1978923,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/820047,University of Berne
Horizon 2020,UEMHP,Unravelling Earth’s magnetic history and processes,"We wish to understand how magnetic fields are generated in the cores of planets. This process is called the dynamo mechanism, whose understanding remains one of the geophysical grand challenges. In cores of rocky planets and in gas giants, thermal forcing results in convection and the resulting flow of liquid metal transports heat and generates magnetic fields as a result of the electrical currents that are induced by their motion. Magnetic field generation affects heat transport and cooling, controlling planetary history and evolution (on Earth it is connected with the growth of the inner core); and ultimately the presence or not of magnetic fields can control the existence of life. To understand the process, the momentum, induction and heat equations must be solved in three dimensions as a function of time in a spherical geometry and linked to the numerous extant data sets that are available. Present-day computer simulations do this by implementing fluid viscosities that are too large by many orders of magnitude. Our aim is to correct this by creating a working computer code that correctly implements a novel theory for the dynamo process in which viscosity and inertia have negligible effects, as is correct for the planets. These dynamos are likely to be different from any previous computational dynamo presented over the last 25 years. The potential rewards of such a correct theory and implementation will be great. We will understand how self-sustained dynamos equilibrate in this never-explored regime, and discover strengths and geometries of generated magnetic fields as a function of forcing. We will discover how to find reversing dynamos, just like on Earth, and understand the mechanisms at play. We will understand the energy requirements, ultimately understand core cooling and also be able to make more accurate predictions of future field evolution. We also aim to understand the new data returning from missions to the giant planets.",Andrew Jackson,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,833848,ERC-2018-ADG,Advanced Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE10 - Earth System Science,2018,43739,45747,2494725,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/833848,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,BEFINE,mechanical BEhavior of Fluid-INduced Earthquakes,"Fluids play an important role in fault zone and in earthquakes generation. Fluid pressure reduces the normal effective stress, lowering the frictional strength of the fault, potentially triggering earthquake ruptures. Fluid injection induced earthquakes (FIE) are direct evidence of the effect of fluid pressure on the fault strength. In addition, natural earthquake sequences are often associated with high fluid pressures at seismogenic depths. Although simple in theory, the mechanisms that govern the nucleation, propagation and recurrence of FIEs are poorly constrained, and our ability to assess the seismic hazard that is associated with natural and induced events remains limited. This project aims to enhance our knowledge of FIE mechanisms over entire seismic cycles through multidisciplinary approaches, including the following: - Set-up and installation of a new and unique rock friction apparatus that is dedicated to the study of FIEs.- Low strain rate friction experiments (coupled with electrical conductivity measurements) to investigate the influence of fluids on fault creep and earthquake recurrence. - Intermediate strain rate friction experiments to investigate the effect of fluids on fault stability during earthquake nucleation. - High strain rate friction experiments to investigate the effect of fluids on fault weakening during earthquake propagation.- Post-mortem experimental fault analyses with state-of-art microstructural techniques.- The theoretical friction law will be calibrated with friction experiments and faulted rock microstructural observations. These steps will produce fundamental discoveries regarding natural earthquakes and tectonic processes and help scientists understand and eventually manage the occurrence of induced seismicity, an increasingly hot topic in geo-engineering.

Horizon 2020,STROMATA,Micro-pyrites associated with organic material in ancient stromatolites: a new proxy attesting for their biogenicity,"Identifying Archean fossil remains from the Earth’s early biosphere is ambitious and determining the biological origin and the associated metabolic pathways present in these fossils is one outstanding question in the bigger quest of how life evolved on Earth. Stromatolites and Microbially Induced Sedimentary Structures (MISS) are considered as one of the earliest evidence of Life in Earth’s history, and can be found from the Archean to the present time. Stromatolites are “attached laminated, sedimentary growth structure accretionary away from a point of initiation”, and their morphological comparison with actual structure prevail for assessing the microbial origin of ancient stromatolite in the geological record. However, experimental studies have shown that abiotic precipitation can also form structures with a similar morphology. Therefore stable isotope proxies have been used to identify past microbial metabolisms even if abiotic processes can also produce similar isotope composition. Therefore new biogenicity criteria are needed to be determined by studying modern and ancient stromatolites and by comparing them to abiotic experiment. Stromatolites and MISS contain submicrometer sulfides (pyrite) that can have recorded large isotopic variations, interpreted as reflecting the influence of various microbial metabolisms like microbial sulfate reduction and iron respiration. STROMATA proposes to define new criteria based on actual stromatolite and to test the earliest traces of life by studying in situ these nano-pyrites in various emblematic and well-characterized samples from the Archean. STROMATA will be the first far-reaching scientific in situ study of nano-pyrite in ancient (3.4 to 1.9 Ga) and modern microbial mats and stromatolites and will compare the results with experimentally produced abiotic pyrite.

Horizon 2020,RAVEN,Rapid mass loss of debris covered glaciers in High Mountain Asia,"The research proposed uses an integrated data-modelling approach to elucidate the role that debris-covered glaciers play in the water cycle of High Mountain Asia (HMA) and establish how future HMA glacier and runoff will evolve. Debris-covered glaciers are of great significance for the hydrology of HMA, with large contributions to headwater streamflow. Despite this, their mass balance, hydrological role and future changes are poorly constrained, challenging model predictions of future water resources. Debris mantles insulate the ice and reduce ablation, but large-scale research indicates that HMA debris-covered glaciers are losing mass at rates similar to debris-free glaciers. This anomalous behaviour has profound implications for future glacier mass balance and runoff, but has not been reproduced with models, a fundamental limitation to a global assessment. I aim to establish that: 1) supraglacial cliffs and ponds are responsible for higher than expected mass losses of HMA debris-covered glaciers, because they act as windows of energy transfer through the debris; and that 2) their inclusion into models of glacier evolution will provide essential new estimates of glacier changes and future water availability in HMA. RAVEN will achieve these aims through combination of high-resolution satellite observations, field data and physically-based models in four sites along the Himalayan arc. This unprecedented setup captures the variety of climate and glaciers across HMA. Using satellite images I will investigate the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of cliffs and ponds; the insights will be used to develop physically-based models of cliff and pond ablation, which will be included in a glacio-hydrological model.

Horizon 2020,INTEXseas,"An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons","Single extreme weather events can be hazardous, but for certain socioeconomic sectors the seasonal aggregation of weather is particularly harmful. Extremes on timescales up to two weeks are typically related to specific weather systems, but no such link exists for extreme seasons. Therefore, they are very difficult to meteorologically understand, despite their utmost societal relevance. This project aims at filling this gap, providing a multi-faceted analysis of different types of extreme seasons in a changing climate. Very large ensembles of climate simulations serve to investigate the characteristics and dynamics of the, e.g., hottest and coldest, and wettest and driest, season in regions worldwide. The extreme season characteristics include their spatial scale and their extremeness given the entire distribution of seasonal values in this region. Their dynamics is related to the fundamental understanding of the sequence of weather events that makes a season extreme: is it a single, highly unusual weather event that renders a season the most extreme (e.g., an unprecedented heat wave) or rather an unusual frequency of well-known weather systems (e.g., a series of strongly precipitating cyclones). These paradigms, referred to as “something new” vs. “more of the same”, are particularly relevant when considering extreme seasons in a warming climate. This project will combine state-of-the-art climate modelling, a unique set of weather-system diagnostics informed by profound dynamical understanding, and novel impact assessment pathways to address three main hypotheses: 1) different types of extreme seasons differ in terms of their spatial scale and relation to weather systems; 2) for specific types of extreme seasons, future climate simulations indicate a marked increase of extremeness; and 3) for certain socioeconomic sectors, the consequences of the future modulation of extreme seasons is more severe than inferred from climate change trend considerations alone.",Johann Heinrich Wernli,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,787652,ERC-2017-ADG,Advanced Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE10 - Earth System Science,2017,43405,45230,2500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/787652,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,IRMIDYN,Iron mineral dynamics in redox-affected soils and sediments: Pushing the frontier toward in-situ studies,"IRMIDYN will study the dynamics of redox-driven iron mineral transformation processes in soils and sediments and impacts on nutrient and trace element behavior using a novel approach based on enriched stable isotopes (e.g., 57Fe, 33S, 67Zn, 113Cd, 198Hg) in combination with innovative experiments and cutting-edge analytical techniques, most importantly 57Fe Mössbauer and Raman micro-spectroscopy and imaging. The thermodynamic stability and occurrence of iron minerals in sufficiently stable Earth surface environments is fairly well understood and supported by field observations. However, the kinetics of iron mineral recrystallization and transformation processes under rapidly changing redox conditions is far less understood, and has to date mostly been studied in in mixed reactors with pure minerals or sediment slurries, but rarely in-situ in complex soils and sediments. Thus, we do not know if and how fast certain iron mineral recrystallization and transformation processes observed in the laboratory actually occur in soils and sediments, and which environmental factors control the transformation rates and products. Redox-driven iron mineral recrystallization and transformation processes are key to understanding the biogeochemical cycles of C, N, P, S, and many trace elements (e.g., As, Zn, Cd, Hg, U). In face of current global challenges caused by massive anthropogenic changes in biogeochemical cycles of nutrients and toxic elements, it is paramount that we begin to understand and quantify the dynamics of these processes in-situ and learn how we can apply our mechanistic (but often reductionist) knowledge to the natural environment.

Horizon 2020,PALAEO-RA,A Palaeoreanalysis To Understand Decadal Climate Variability,"Climatic variations at decadal scales, such as phases of accelerated warming, weak monsoons, or widespread subtropical drought, have profound effects on society and the economy. Understanding such variations requires insights from the past. However, no data sets of past climate are available to study decadal variability of large-scale climate with state-of-the-art diagnostic methods. Currently available data sets are limited to statistical reconstructions of local or regional surface climate. The PALAEO-RA project will produce the first ever comprehensive, 3-dimensional, physically consistent reconstruction of the global climate system at a monthly scale for the past six centuries. This palaeoreanalysis is based on combining information from early instrumental measurements, historical documents (e.g., capitalizing on large amounts of newly available data from China), and proxies (e.g., tree rings) with a large ensemble of climate model simulations. To achieve this novel combination, a completely new data assimilation system for palaeoclimatological data will be developed. The unique data sets produced in this project will become reference data sets for studying past climatic variations (i) for diagnostic studies of interannual-to-decadal variability, (ii) as a benchmark for model simulations and (iii) for climate impact studies. Using the data produced, the project will analyse episodes of slowed or accelerated global warming, decadal subtropical drought periods, episodes of expanding or contracting tropics, slowed or strengthened monsoons, changes in storm tracks, blocking and associated weather extremes, and links between Arctic and midlatitude climate.

Horizon 2020,UltraPal,Ultimate Paleo-Ocean Records from Biogenic Calcites,"The ambition with this proposal is to create ultimate paleo-environmental records for the oceans. This is a fundamental scientific challenge and the motivation is simple: The oceans take up 70% of the Earth’s surface area and represent an immense sink/source of, e.g., heat and CO2, which makes them key to the evolution of Earth’s climate. Assessing and understanding anthropogenic global climate change requires that role of the oceans is understood in detail. Proxies are needed to establish past ocean conditions with high accuracy.    Calcite has played a fundamental role in these efforts because isotopic and trace element compositions of limestone and calcitic fossils are related to ocean conditions at the time of their formation. Geochemical studies of calcite in the ocean sediment record have therefore contributed enormously to the understanding of Earth’s climatic evolution over the last several hundred million years.     However, our recent work (Bernard et al., Nature Communications, 2017) identifies a fundamental problem: Visually imperceptible, ultrastructure-level processes that occur during sediment diagenesis can introduce a very strong bias in these records, in particular those based on biogenic calcite; i.e., structures produced by living organisms such as foraminifera and brachiopods. Previously not investigated or taken into account, such ultrastructure-level diagenesis will (and does) create large errors in ocean paleo-environmental reconstructions, even under the close-to-ambient pressure and temperature conditions characterizing shallow sediment burial. This proposal offers a solution: An entirely new, interdisciplinary approach, including ultra-high-resolution isotopic imaging (NanoSIMS), is developed here to quantify these effects in a broad range of biogenic calcites, permitting genuinely non-biased, calcite-based paleo-ocean reconstructions to be created. The impact of this work on climate change research will be dramatic and immediate.",Anders Meibom,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,788752,ERC-2017-ADG,Advanced Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE10 - Earth System Science,2017,43466,45657,2435000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/788752,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,DISCOVERHEP,Turning noise into data: a discovery strategy for new weakly-interacting physics,"The ATLAS and CMS Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have done an excellent job in searching for new high-energy physics, pushing out to energy scales which have never before been studied. In contrast, low-energy physics has only been studied in specific contexts at the LHC, and remains largely uncovered in the search for new physics. Despite the main focus being on the high-energy regime, it is entirely possible that new physics is instead hiding in the low-energy regime, and it was not observed in previous collider physics experiments due to being rarely produced.

In the context of the DISCOVERHEP project, I will lead a group in the search for new physics in the largely-uncovered low-energy regime. The project will exploit the very-high LHC beam intensity to turn ""noise"", in the form of traditionally unwanted and ignored additional simultaneous proton-proton collisions, into a currently-untapped wealth of useful low-energy physics data. This novel approach thereby opens up the possibility of conducting high-sensitivity searches for low-energy physics at the LHC.

This massive low-energy physics dataset will be used to enable the project goals, in the form of searches for new low-energy weakly-interacting physics conducted using the ATLAS Detector. Three different search strategies, sensitive to different types of new physics, are considered: two types of direct searches for new light particles such as potential mediators between the Standard Model and Dark Matter, and one generic search for new low-energy physics using anomaly detection techniques. These searches will dramatically extend the sensitivity of ATLAS to new low-energy physics, thus expanding the ATLAS physics program and potentially leading the way towards new discoveries.",Steven Schramm,University of Geneva,Switzerland,-,948254,ERC-2020-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE2 - Fundamental Constituents of Matter,2020,44287,46112,1499975,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/948254,University of Geneva
Horizon 2020,KAIROS,"Bootstrapping Time: Colliders, Shocks, Strings, and Black Holes","Two pillars of modern physics are Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and General Relativity (GR). Together they describe a vast corpus of phenomena ranging from the smallest scales accessible with modern accelerators to the largest distances observed with modern telescopes. Establishing these frameworks is a triumph of 20th-century physics.   Our understanding of both is not satisfactory. On the QFT side, we lack tools to analyze the strong coupling regime. On the GR side, we do not understand how to make it quantum. The insight of holography is that these two problems are deeply connected, in other words, QFT and Quantum Gravity (QG) are different realizations of the same underlying mathematical structure and physical principles. Providing us with this fundamental insight, holography does not tell us what the underlying structure is. The challenge for 21st-century physics is to understand it.    The aim of the present proposal is to establish a research team at CERN that: a) will {\it develop new nonperturbative Lorentzian bootstrap methods} as a part of a larger quest of revealing the unifying mathematical structure and physical principles that underlie both QFT and QG; b) use these methods for state-of-the-art {\it computations of  real-time physical observables} which are not accessible using conventional methods. This will lead to new insights into the fundamental properties of QFT, QG, and holography which relates the two. The principal novelty of the project is in its focus on the nonperturbative real-time dynamics, as opposed to Euclidean observables which are typically studied using the current bootstrap or other methods.   Bootstrap takes fundamental principles of physics, such as causality, locality, and unitarity, and pushes their consequences to the extreme. Combined with insights from holography, bootstrap methods offer an unprecedented set of tools for diving into uncharted territories of QFT and QG.",Alexander Zhiboedov,European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN),Switzerland,-,949077,ERC-2020-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE2 - Fundamental Constituents of Matter,2020,44197,46022,1455000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/949077,European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)
Horizon 2020,FASERnu,Studying Neutrinos at the High Energy Frontier,"Although the properties of neutrinos have been intensively studied, we are still missing data about their behaviour in the TeV energy scale, as well as conclusive tests of lepton universality in neutrino scattering. Embracing the discussions on recently identified flavour anomalies, which hint at lepton universality violation, the study of high-energy neutrino interactions involving both heavy leptons and heavy quarks may be a powerful and complementary tool to search for new physics effects. Such interaction channels require high neutrino energy. 
Here I propose to measure high energy neutrinos with a detector sensitive to heavy flavour particles. This project (FASERnu) employs a novel approach to exploit the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as an intense neutrino source, which allows for the study of the high energy frontier of man-made neutrinos. An emulsion hybrid neutrino detector with a target mass of 1.2 tonnes will be employed. Such a detector structure has been well proven to be sensitive to heavy flavour particles: tau, charm and beauty. Data taking will be carried out during the forthcoming Run 3 of LHC operation (2021-2024), which would yield >20,000 neutrino interactions in the detector. During the timeline of this grant, neutrino cross sections will be measured for all three flavours in the uncharted energy range between 360 GeV and 6 TeV. Furthermore, the channels associated with heavy quark (charm and beauty) production will be studied. 
I established this project within the framework of the FASER experiment. The letter of intent and technical proposal of this project were approved by the CERN committees and I presently act as one of the project leaders of the neutrino program in FASER. FASERnu will not only investigate an unexplored energy regime, but will also provide relevant inputs to future neutrino experiments at the High-Luminosity-LHC (HL-LHC) and then at the Future Circular Collider (FCC).",Akitaka Ariga,University of Bern,Switzerland,-,101002690,ERC-2020-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE2 - Fundamental Constituents of Matter,2020,44440,46265,1998125,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101002690,University of Berne
Horizon 2020,TOPUP,Theory of particle collider processes at ultimate precision,"The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN probes the interaction of elementary particles at unprecedented energy and to very high precision. The full exploitation of the upcoming data from the LHC relies on a close interplay between theory and experiment, which calls in particular for highly accurate theoretical predictions. This theoretical accuracy can be achieved only though the expansion of the fundamental scattering amplitudes to sufficiently high order in perturbation theory.

This project aims to meet this challenge for modern collider physics by providing the conceptual and technical foundations for theory predictions at ultimate precision. TOPUP will develop and establish a new standard of theoretical precision in the description of physical observables at the LHC based on perturbation theory expanded to the third non-trivial order (N3LO). We will achieve this ambitious goal by targeting the main obstacles in present-day methods, and by developing novel ways for the computation of multi-loop scattering amplitudes and in the understanding and handling of unresolved multi-particle emission.

The concrete goal of the project is to enable theoretical predictions at ultimate precision for multiple processes in high-energy particle collisions with full final state kinematical information. This will lead to a more precise extraction of fundamental physics parameters, such as couplings and particle masses. The newly developed methods will be applied to the derivation of the process-independent four-loop corrections to the Altarelli-Parisi splitting functions, the three-loop matrix elements for a number of fundamental scattering processes and fully differential N3LO predictions for several process-specific key observables. These calculations will shape and challenge the newly developed methods in cutting-edge applications and provide crucial input to the theoretical interpretation of the LHC precision physics program.",Thomas Kurt Gehrmann,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,101019620,ERC-2020-ADG,Advanced Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE2 - Fundamental Constituents of Matter,2020,44440,46265,2459915,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101019620,University of Zurich
Horizon 2020,TANQ,Taming Non-Equilibrium Quantum Matter,"Recent experimental breakthroughs led to realization of tunable, synthetic quantum systems that allow one to probe and manipulate highly non-equilibrium quantum matter. Driving a system ouf-of-equilibrium changes its properties in unexpected ways, opening opportunities for realizing new states of matter. The central goal of this project is to develop a fundamental theoretical understanding of non-equilibrium dynamics and highly excited eigenstates in quantum many-body systems. The conventional wisdom tells that a non-equilibrium system thermalizes, and can then be described by statistical-mechanics. However, recent breakthroughs revealed an experimentally relevant class of systems, the prime example being disordered, many-body localized (MBL) systems, which defy this wisdom, avoiding thermalization. Ergodicity-breaking systems open new avenues for protecting quantum coherence, and for realizing new non-equilibrium phases of matter. We will study the fundamental mechanisms of ergodicity breaking using a multi-disciplinary approach, which builds on techniques from quantum information, condensed matter physics, quantum optics and mathematical physics. We aim to establish universality classes of quantum dynamics, by studying disordered systems with symmetries, and by characterizing entirely new mechanisms of ergodicity breaking, such as quantum many-body scars. In order to overcome the exponential growth of the many-body Hilbert space, new efficient renormalization and tensor-network methods based on quantum entanglement will be developed. Finally, approaches for manipulating quantum matter and realizing new non-equilibrium phases in ongoing experiments will be developed.
The completion of this project will lead to a universal theoretical framework for non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, complementing statistical-mechanics in ergodic systems.

Horizon 2020,MONOLITH,Monolithic Multi-Junction Picosecond Avalanche Detector for future physics experiments and applications,"Particle-physics, space research and several other fields of basic and applied science necessitate the production of thin sensors capable to provide excellent position and time resolution at the same time.
The diode structure of present silicon pixel sensors strongly penalises the enormous potential of silicon-based time measurement: the ~30 ps intrinsic limit of diodes was already reached in sensors with internal gain with pad sizes of 1 mm2. Therefore, new ideas are needed to improve by another order of magnitude and reach the picosecond level.
This project introduces a novel silicon-sensor structure devised to overcome the intrinsic limits of present sensors and simultaneously provide picosecond timing and high spatial resolution in a monolithic implementation. This goal is achieved by the introduction of a fully depleted multi-junction. The remarkable performance of this new sensor, combined with the simplified assembly process and reduced production cost offered by the monolithic implementation in standard CMOS processes, represent the required breakthrough.
In addition to the novel multi-junction sensor, the cornerstones of the project are the low-noise very-fast SiGe HBT frontend and the patented TDC with robust synchronisation method that the PI has already produced in preliminary versions.
The monolithic detector proposed here will offer a sustainable solution for the next generation of experiments at hadron colliders, in nuclear physics and for space-borne experiments in cosmic-ray physics and solar physics. Besides the primary goal of basic science, it will represent an extraordinary enabling technology for the large spectrum of high-tech applications that benefits of picosecond-level Time-Of-Flight measurements. The innovative monolithic detector introduced here will also offer a starting point for further progress in the field of light detection.

Horizon 2020,IONPEN,Trapped-ion quantum information in 2-dimensional Penning trap arrays,"This project will develop a new platform for quantum computation and quantum simulation based on scalable two-dimensional arrays of ions in micro-fabricated Penning traps. It builds upon the rapid advances demonstrating high precision quantum control in micro-fabricated radio-frequency ion traps while eliminating the most problematic element - the radio-frequency potential - using a uniform magnetic field. This offers a significant advantage: since the magnetic field is uniform it provides confinement at any position for which a suitable static quadrupole can be generated. By contrast, r.f. potentials only provide good working conditions along a line. This changed perspective provides access to dense two-dimensional strongly interacting ion lattices, with the possibility to re-configure these lattices in real time. By combining closely-spaced static two-dimensional ion arrays with standard laser control methods, the project will demonstrate previously inaccessible many-body interacting spin Hamiltonians at ion numbers which are out of the reach of classical computers, providing a scalable quantum simulator with the potential to provide new insights into the links between microscopic physics and emergent behavior. Through dynamic control of electrode voltages, reconfigurable two-dimensional arrays will be used to realize a scalable quantum computing architecture, which will be benchmarked through landmark experiments on measurement-based quantum computation and high error-threshold surface codes which are natural to this configuration. Realizing multi-dimensional connectivity between qubits is a major problem facing a number of leading quantum computing architectures including trapped ions.

Horizon 2020,Mu-MASS,Muonium Laser Spectroscopy,"Striking anomalies in the muon sector have accumulated in recent years: notably the famous anomalous muon magnetic moment (g-2) and the muonic hydrogen Lamb shift measurement which prompted the so-called proton charge radius puzzle. These tantalizing results triggered vibrant activity on both experimental and theoretical sides. Different explanations have been put forward including exciting solutions invoking New Physics beyond the Standard Model. To contribute to clarifying the origin of these anomalies, I propose Mu-MASS, an experiment aiming for a 1000-fold improvement in the determination of the 1S-2S transition frequency of Muonium (M), the positive-muon/electron bound state. This substantial improvement beyond the current state-of-the-art relies on the novel cryogenic M converters and confinement techniques developed by the PI, and on the new laser and detection schemes which the PI implemented for positronium spectroscopy. This experiment will be performed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). With the Mu-MASS result our knowledge of the muon mass can be improved by almost two orders of magnitude.  By using the expected results of the ongoing hyperfine splitting measurement of M in Japan, it will provide one of the most sensitive tests of bound-state Quantum Electrodynamics. It can also be used to extract the muon g-2 from the ongoing experiment at Fermilab. Since M is a unique system composed of two different leptons (point-like particles), the Mu-MASS results will provide the most stringent test of charge equality between the lepton generations. Moreover, it can be used to determine the Rydberg constant free from nuclear and finite-size effects and contribute to solving the proton charge radius puzzle. Mu-MASS is thus very timely and essential to the worldwide effort to understand the interesting observed discrepancies, which could be a hint of New Physics and therefore have profound implications on our understanding of the Universe.",Paolo Crivelli,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,818053,ERC-2018-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE2 - Fundamental Constituents of Matter,2018,43497,45322,1999150,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/818053,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,FLAY,Flavor Anomalies and the origin of the Yukawa couplings,"Recent experimental results in flavor physics exhibit deviations from the Standard Model predictions that are growing with time, both as far as statistical significance and as far as internal consistency. Understanding the origin of this phenomenon, the so-called “flavor anomalies”, is of paramount importance for a deeper understanding of fundamental interactions. As recently shown by the PI and collaborators, this phenomenon is likely to be intimately related to the long-standing “flavor problem”, or the origin of the hierarchical pattern of quark and lepton mass matrices observed in Nature. The goal of this project is to shed light on both these issues, providing a solution to old and recent puzzles in flavor physics. We propose to address these questions via an original bottom-up approach, based on Effective Field Theory methods and simplified models, combined with new top-down ideas about the ultraviolet completion of the Standard Model. On the phenomenological side, the proposed bottom-up approach will allow us to exploit with the highest accuracy all the available and expected experimental data. It will allow us to take into account both low- and high-energy observables, as well as both quark and lepton sectors. These results will constitute the basis for the theoretical investigation of a new class of Standard Model extensions not considered so far. The latter are based on new ideas, such as flavor non-universal gauge interactions, that imply a change of paradigm in theoretical high-energy physics: the origin of the flavor hierarchies plays a central role in revealing the ultraviolet completion of the Standard Model.

To achieve this, I will build on my expertise devising and organizing new physics searches with leptons and will establish and lead a new multi-signature research programme at the CMS experiment. This programme will exploit both the intensity and energy frontiers opening up at the LHC and can be further expanded at the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).

Horizon 2020,mPP,machine learning for Particle Physics,"This project proposes to use modern Machine Learning (ML),  particularly Deep Learning (DL), as a breakthrough solution to address the scientific, technological, and financial challenges that High Energy Physics (HEP) will face in the decade ahead. The quest for new physics is increasing the complexity of the experiments and, consequently, the human and financial costs to operate these detectors, with experiments facing at best flat budgets. ML offers a way out of this impasse. With the development of DL, ML has successfully addressed tasks such as image recognition and text understanding, which eventually opened the way to automatizing complex tasks. These progresses have the potential to revolutionize HEP experimental techniques. We propose to apply cutting-edge ML technologies to HEP problems, paving the way to self-operating detectors, capable of visually inspecting events and identifying the physics process generating them, while monitoring the goodness of the data, the correct functioning of the detector components and, if any, the occurrence of anomalous events caused by unspecified new physics processes.

We propose to apply ML to data taking, event identification, data-taking monitoring, and event reconstruction as intermediate steps toward using these techniques for unsupervised physics searches.

Horizon 2020,AQE2D,Atomic Quantum Emitters in 2D Frameworks,"The ability to create and control connected quantum states established the advent of quantum information technologies (Q-IT). Manipulation of the electron spin associated with colour centres in solid state crystals is one of the pillar technologies that could eventually push Q-IT beyond cryogenic environments. Exploitation of the full potential of these atomic qubit systems is, however, hampered by two key challenges: the lack of atomistic insights into their properties, and the ability to place them with the required fidelity and atomic spatial precision.

Here I propose to converge recent breakthrough developments in the synthetic control of two-dimensional (2D) materials and ultra-fast, single-atom resolving probes to overcome these challenges. Specifically, I will develop a platform for electro-optically addressable spin qubits (Atomic Quantum Emitters, AQEs) in 2D materials based on atomic dopants in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers and molecular spin systems in 2D covalent organic frameworks (2D-COFs). These systems will provide an ideal platform to generate AQEs by chemical design, to control the mesoscopic environment averting variability between emitters, to achieve atomically precise spatial placement, to identify and eliminate decoherence channels, and to develop high-fidelity scalable pumping schemes.

The proposed construction of a spin-polarized ultrafast THz scanning probe microscope with optical detection capabilities will enable the direct correlation of structural, electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of individual AQEs with simultaneous atomic spatial resolution and picosecond time resolution.

Horizon 2020,QUITAR,Quantum Information Transduction with Acoustic Resonators,"Modern telecommunications networks make use of light in optical fibers to connect devices where information is processed in electronic circuits. Such an architecture can also be used to communicate and process quantum information. Local quantum processors based on superconducting (SC) microwave circuits are now capable of performing sophisticated tasks ranging from quantum simulation to quantum error correction. At the same time, low-loss quantum channels based on infrared (IR) light can transfer quantum information over long distances.  However, the crucial link between these two systems that would allow for the realization of a quantum network is still missing. Since quantum states are much more fragile than classical signals, quantum transduction between the electrical and optical domains must be highly efficient without introducing new sources of decoherence that interfere with the operation of the local processors or long-distance channels. 

The goal of this project is to create a quantum transducer between SC circuits and IR light using a third quantum system: sound waves in an acoustic resonator. My recent work showed that these mechanical resonators possess properties that make them highly promising for implementing a quantum transducer. They couple efficiently to both SC circuits and IR light, and can be used to store and manipulate quantum states of sound. The project will combine electromechanical and optomechanical transduction, which so far has only been implemented separately, in a single system. By developing techniques for integrating optics, acoustics, and microwave circuits at cryogenic temperatures, I will demonstrate the conversion of complex quantum states between the microwave and IR domains and use this capability to entangle remote SC quantum nodes. Reaching this goal will be the crucial first step toward using SC circuits to implement a quantum network for long-distance communications or to build a large-scale, modular quantum computer.

Horizon 2020,ACTIVE_ADAPTIVE,Active and Adaptive: Reconfigurable Active Colloids with Internal Feedback and Communication Schemes,"The vision of creating autonomous materials constituted of microscale motile units promises to disrupt a broad range of technologies but is still far beyond our reach. Inspired by nature, these materials are active, i.e. they convert available energy into functions, and adaptive, i.e. they respond to stimuli by reconfiguring via internal feedback and signalling schemes. In order to progress, we need to rethink the way in which we design, fabricate and control synthetic active units, aka active colloids or artificial microswimmers. 

I propose an innovative approach that combines colloidal synthesis, assembly and actuation with nanofabrication and the implementation of feedback to realize a new class of active colloids. Borrowing ideas from soft-robotic systems, we aim to realize and study “cyber-free” artificial microswimmers, which, in addition to on-board energy conversion, present internal degrees of freedom allowing for sensing, feedback and communication pathways ultimately to be regulated without external intervention. In particular, we will: 1) Numerically and experimentally implement feedback schemes to regulate single-particle motility and collective behaviour based on control theory. 2) Use a unique combination of capillary assembly and two-photon nanolithography to create shape-shifting active colloids that autonomously regulate their motility based on stimuli orthogonal to their propulsion schemes. 3) Create “transmitting” and “receiving” active colloids, sending and sensing chemical signals (pH changes), to regulate their motility. 

By introducing strong coupling between particles, and with stimuli beyond classical colloidal interactions, this proposal will enable a forward leap in the study of the emergent physics of active systems, as required to realize the vision of autonomous materials and microscale devices.

We will address the pertinent question on the mechanism of reactivity of 2D materials with aqueous electrolytes at ambient conditions and the role of the defects on the dynamics of interfacial charges. At the start of the project, we will explore defects hosted in two classes of 2D materials: hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Our plans are to define strategies to extend defect imaging combined with other characterization approaches to a multitude of 2D materials. In parallel, we will explore the role of interfacial liquid taking advantage of novel nanofluidic platforms termed angstrom slits that will allow fine-tuning the balance between 2D and 3D liquid.

Horizon 2020,OptimHist,Optimization and historical contingency in living systems: a biophysical approach,"Populations of living organisms are pushed to optimality by evolution, but may also be shaped by the contingency of their evolutionary history. The recent explosion of sequence data gives us access to the outcomes of molecular evolution, and controlled microbial evolution experiments allow us to analyze the predictability of evolution. In this exciting context, I aim to explore quantitatively the importance of optimization and contingency both at the molecular scale and at the scale of populations of microorganisms, using a theoretical biophysical approach.

First, I will assess how functional optimization and evolutionary history, i.e. phylogeny, shape protein sequences. Importantly, correlations arising from phylogeny are a double-edged sword, often confounding signal from functional optimization, but sometimes providing useful complementary information. I will improve sequence-based predictions for protein-protein interactions by exploiting information both from phylogeny and from the required complementarity of interacting residues. I will disentangle the collective modes of correlations in protein sequences due to optimization from those due to phylogeny, and investigate the importance of functional sectors as an organizing principle of proteins. This will be a breakthrough in our understanding of the sequence-function relationship of proteins.

Second, I will analyze the impact of optimization and contingency on the evolution of microbial populations. I will study microorganisms with a rugged fitness landscape presenting several optima. In these realistic cases, populations tend to remain trapped in local optima. However, most real populations possess specific geographic structures. I will quantitatively study how structure helps populations to explore model and real rugged fitness landscapes. I will build a universal model of structured populations.

Non-collinear, engineered spin textures, such as Skyrmions of helimagnetism, offer a current frontier that I will address, with possibly far-reaching impact for the field of spintronics. I will further harness the high-frequency sensing capabilities of our quantum sensors to address microwave-domain spin-waves in vdW magnets. This completely uncharted domain offers insight into still poorly understood spin interactions and has technological potential through the field of ""vdW magnonics"", which I plan to establish.

This challenging project combines advanced materials engineering with an emerging, and highly promising quantum sensing technology. It is thereby highly interdisciplinary and goes well beyond the state-of-the-art in the fields of vdW magnetism and quantum-sensing. I will thereby further strengthen Europe's position at the forefront of these flourishing research areas.

Horizon 2020,Topo2DEG,Topological states in superconducting two-dimensional electron gases,"I will experimentally investigate hybrid superconductor/semiconductor devices for realizing novel topological states of matter, with interest both in fundamental physics and quantum computing applications. Common denominator of the proposed experiments is a regime where the characteristic energy scales of the system, namely Fermi energy, spin orbit interaction correction, superconducting gap and Zeeman splitting are comparable to each other, resulting in unique and mostly uncharted physical territories. Differently from the most widespread use of semiconductor nanowires coupled to superconductors, I will employ novel hybrid two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) where the superconductor is grown in-situ and matched to the semiconductor lattice. This novel system was mainly developed by the team I supervise, during the last two years. Compared to the conventional nanowire-based approach, hybrid 2DEGs are readily available, characterized by very low disorder and more amenable to complex sample designs. The work will focus on: 1) Taking full advantage of the planar geometry to study spatial and non-local properties of individual Majorana wires, as well as branched geometries. These experiments will constitute critical tests to establish if the commonly observed zero bias peaks are indeed associated with Majorana modes and pave the way to complex networks of interacting Majorana wires, a requirement for quantum computing. 2) Studying topological phenomena in multi-terminal Josephson junctions (JJs), with particular emphasis on tuning the superconducting phase difference across electrodes pairs. Topological JJs offer a new and possibly advantageous path forward to create and manipulate Majorana modes not explored up to date, including the possibility to reach the topological regime for vanishing small external magnetic fields, useful for applications.

Horizon 2020,IMAGINE,Non-Invasive Imaging of Nanoscale Electronic Transport,"Electronic transport in nanostructures and thin films shows a rich variety of physical effects that have been fundamental to the development of modern electronics and communication devices. The standard method for investigating electronic transport – resistance measurements – does not provide any information on the nanoscale current distribution in such structures. The lack of spatial information is unfortunate, because the current distribution plays a key role in many intriguing physical phenomena. Having a technique at hand that could simply look at nanoscale current flow would be immensely valuable.In this project we propose to exploit sensitive magnetic microscopy to directly access the current distribution in nanostructures with ~15nm spatial resolution. Our approach is based on the recent technique of scanning diamond magnetometry (SDM), a scanned-probe method that utilizes a single spin in a diamond tip as a high-resolution sensor of magnetic field. Conceived in 2008 by the PI, SDM exploits quantum metrology to achieve very high sensitivities, and has recently enabled a breakthrough in the passive analysis of magnetic surfaces. Our proposal has three objectives: (i) Lay the instrumental and conceptual groundwork required for imaging tiny (<10nA) current variations in two-dimensional conductors. (ii) Demonstrate imaging of a variety of mesoscopic transport features on a well-established model system: Mono- and bilayer graphene. (iii) Explore the potential of our technique for probing electronic properties beyond transport, like phase transitions and photoexcitation.Together, our experiments are designed to establish a powerful new technology for imaging current distributions non-invasively and with nanometer spatial resolution.

Revealing the adaptive internal organization and dynamics of bacteria and mitochondria","Bacteria cells appear to be less complex than our own cells -- yet they are better able to survive harsh conditions. Typically ~1 micron in size, they lack motor proteins; thus, they rely on fluctuations for intracellular transport. Bacteria in the environment often face starvation and exist in a non-proliferating quiescent state, which promotes antibiotic resistance and virulence. Entering quiescence, the bacterial cytoplasm displays signatures of the colloidal glass transition, with increasingly slow and heterogeneous diffusion. Also important for fitness during starvation is the formation of storage granules up to hundreds of nanometers in size. The complex state behavior of the bacterial cytoplasm is therefore important for their survival, but the physical nature of each of these processes is poorly understood. Our own cells are typically tens of microns in size and contain organelles including mitochondria, which originated from ancient bacterial endosymbionts. But little is known about the transport properties of the mitochondrial matrix, or how it responds to changes in mitochondrial membrane potential or energy production. The goal of this project is to elucidate the organization and dynamics of the bacterial cytoplasm and the mitochondrial matrix. A major obstacle to studying the interior of bacteria and mitochondria is the relevant length scales, which lie below the diffraction limit. Furthermore, to observe and quantify their adaptive response, many cells must be measured. Our strategy to overcome both of these technical challenges is to use high-throughput super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. We have developed new microscopes, capable of capturing thousands of super-resolved cells in each experiment. We propose to translate these developments to dynamic structured illumination and long-term molecular tracking. Broadly applicable, this will also enable the quantitative study of the subcellular properties of single bacteria cells or mitochondria.",Suliana Manley,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,819823,ERC-2018-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE3 - Condensed Matter Physics,2018,43739,45930,2366835,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/819823,EPF Lausanne

Horizon 2020,ExCOM-cCEO,Extremely Coherent Mechanical Oscillators and circuit Cavity Electro-Optics,"The quest for mechanical oscillators with ultralow dissipation is motivated by classical and quantum sensing and technology, and precision measurements. For decades, the most coherent mechanical oscillators were acoustic vibrations in kg-scale crystalline bars. Recently a paradigm shift has occurred. The combination of elastic strain engineering – a technique used in microelectronics – with phononic mode engineering has resulted in 1D nano-strings with a mechanical quality factor Q of 0.8 billion – the highest ever achieved at room temperature. Remarkably, these new techniques have major untapped potential, as they have only been applied to non-crystalline materials in 1D. We propose a new generation of strain-engineered crystalline and superconducting mechanical oscillators whose Q-factors are predicted to exceed 100 billion in up to 2 dimensions. We will seek to reach this theoretical limit, probe new dissipation mechanisms, and utilize these oscillators for quantum optomechanics in new regimes and achieve room temperature ground state cooling and ponderomotive squeezing. Likewise, we will apply these techniques to create highly coherent superconducting electromechanical devices at milli-Kelvin temperatures, enabling quantum-enhanced force sensing and 1 second decoherence times. Secondly, we will explore a fundamentally new method for measurement and manipulation of microwave fields with optical fields – the nascent field of circuit Cavity-Electro-Optics (cCEO). First recognized over a decade ago, it is possible with optical fields to cool, amplify or interferometrically read out microwaves. Yet to date this regime has remained in accessible due to insufficient coupling strength between the microwave and optical fields. We will overcome this challenge based on a new circuit architecture, allowing laser cooling and laser amplification of microwaves and electro-optical masing using optical backaction, and thereby opening an entirely new way to manipulate microwaves.",Tobias Kippenberg,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,835329,ERC-2018-ADG,Advanced Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE3 - Condensed Matter Physics,2018,43739,45473,2496000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/835329,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,PrISMoID,Photonic Structural Materials with Controlled Disorder,"Structural colour reflected by photonic materials is typically attributed to highly ordered nanostructures with periodicities on the 100-nm length scale. When investigating structural colour in animals and plants, it is however becoming increasingly evident that brilliant photonic colour can also arise from seemingly disordered morphologies. This is surprising as uncontrolled disorder in photonic materials usually severely degrades their colour response. While some recent theories exist, the emergence of structural colour from disordered morphologies is fundamentally not understood.  It is clear however that these disordered morphologies must possess ""hidden correlations"", which enable the formation of a photonic band gap.

This project will uncover the design rules that underlie disordered photonic morphologies, thereby contributing to the fundamental understanding of photonic materials.  The project has a strong nature-inspired component, but will go beyond the examination of natural photonic materials. WP1 and WP2 will examine 3D and 2D disordered photonic morphologies in animals and plants, respectively.  The structural analysis of these materials will uncover hidden correlations in seemingly random morphologies.  WP2 and WP3 will manufacture materials that implement these correlations to recreate the optical signatures of the biological model organisms.  This will test the statistical analysis of WP1 and WP2 and shed light on the \textit{in vivo} synthesis of the disordered photonic morphologies.  WP4 ties WP1-WP3 together by performing optical experiments and computer simulations.  By analysing both the far- and near-field results of the simulations and comparing them with the structural correlations and optical experiments, the  four WPs will not only provide a fundamental understanding of the interplay of structural correlations with optical interference in disordered materials,  it will also establish design rules allowing their facile manufacture.",Ullrich Steiner,University of Fribourg,Switzerland,-,833895,ERC-2018-ADG,Advanced Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE3 - Condensed Matter Physics,2018,43709,45808,2499990,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/833895,University of Fribourg

My group made, in the last decade, well-recognized experimental and conceptual advances by exploiting and adapting advanced AFM techniques, especially the ultra-sensitive pendulum-AFM, (p-AFM, dissipation sensitivity ~0.1 aW, force sensitivity ~ 10-12N) detecting collective phenomena and phase transitions including structural, electronic, magnetic. This dissipation spectroscopy was applied so far mostly at the equilibrium physics of  3D classical solids. 

The challenge: I propose to extend nanomechanical dissipation spectroscopy to pick up much weaker effects caused by non-equilibrium perturbations, by nanomanipulations, and by quantum effects in carefully picked case studies. Such as measuring the imperceptible wind force exerted on a noncontact tip  by a thermal or electrical current in the surface below, or the minute mechanical cost of creating and dismantling a single spin  Kondo state, or a topological surface state. 

Risks, benefits, relevance: None of this was done before, so despite our experience and good feasibility estimates there is some risk. The benefits however will be substantial. Thermal and electrical migration of defects and impurities is important in materials, and electrical contacts. The dragging, peeling, sensing of 2D systems like graphene nanoribbons and twisted bilayers is hot. And quantum dissipation is pertinent to the limiting factor of quantum information processes. To do all this by nanomechanics will be unique.

The opportunity: My group is ready to put its expertise in these exciting new problems, once I can through an Advanced Grant secure the instrumental and experimental human resources, as well as the theoretical support of additional beneficiary SISSA, indispensable in such a frontier context.

Horizon 2020,ETOPEX,Engineering Topological Phases and Excitations in Nanostructures with Interactions,"The main goal of this theory project is to propose engineered topological phases emerging only in strongly interacting systems and to identify the most feasible systems for experimental implementation. First, we will focus on setups hosting topological states localized at domain walls in one-dimensional channels such as parafermions, which are a new class of non-Abelian anyons and most promising candidates for topological quantum computing schemes. Second, in the framework of weakly coupled wires and planes, we will develop schemes for novel fractional topological phases in two- and three-dimensional interacting systems. To achieve these two goals, my team will identify necessary ingredients such as strong electron-electron interactions, helical magnetic order, or crossed Andreev proximity-induced superconductivity and address each of them separately. Later, we combine them to lead us to the desired topological phases and states. On our way to the main goal, as test cases, we will also study non-interacting analogies of the proposed effects such as Majorana fermions and integer topological insulators and pay close attention to the rapid experimental progress to come up with the most feasible proposals. We will study transport properties, scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy. Especially for systems driven out of equilibrium, we will develop a Floquet-Luttinger liquid technique.

Hierarchical topology, Kondo topological metals, and deep learning","Discovering, classifying and understanding phases of quantum matter is a core goal of condensed matter physics. Next to the notion of symmetry breaking phases, the concept of topological phases of matter is a prevailing theme of recent research. Topological phases are envisioned for various applications due to their universal and robust properties, such as protected conducting boundary modes, and provoke fundamental questions about the nature of many-body quantum states by providing the basis for exotic quasiparticles.In this ERC research project, I propose several new topological phases and novel numerical approaches for studying and classifying the most sought-after topological phases of matter. Concretely, I propose the concept of three-dimensional hierarchical topological insulators, which, in contrast to the known topological phases, do not posses gapless surface, but protected gapless edge modes. Moreover, I plan to study topological metals arising in strongly correlated Kondo systems, going beyond the current paradigm of considering topological metals that arise in the absence of electronic correlations. Furthermore, I propose to make the analogous step for topological superconductors, which have been studied as free models to search for Majorana quasiparticles: For the first time, I want to explore strongly interacting systems that realize the more powerful parafermion quasiparticles with numerical techniques. Finally, in a cross-disciplinary and exploratory sub-project, I will employ methods of deep neural networks to classify strongly correlated quantum phases using supervised learning combined with a technique called deep dreaming.  Each of these sub-projects has the potential to make a paradigm-changing contribution to the study of strongly correlated and topological states of quantum matter and the combination of them allows to take advantage of synergy effects and a balance between high-risk and definitely feasible key developments.",Titus Neupert,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,757867,ERC-2017-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE3 - Condensed Matter Physics,2017,43101,45199,1362401,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/757867,University of Zurich

The understanding and ability to manipulate phonons as quantum particles in solids enable the control of coherent phonon transport, which is of fundamental interest and could also be exploited in applications. Logic operations can be realized with the manipulation of phonons both in their coherent and incoherent form in order to switch, amplify, and route signals, and to store information. If brought to a mature level, phononic devices can become complementary to the conventional electronics, opening new opportunities.I envision to realize each part of this technology exploiting phonons and to bring them together in an integrated circuit on chip: a phononic integrated circuit. The objective of the proposal is:A: the realization of coherent phonon source and detector;B: the realization of phonon computation with the use of thermal logic gates;C: the realization of phonon based quantum and thermal memories.To this end it is crucial to engineer nanoscale heterostructures with suitable interfaces, and to engineer the phonon spectrum and the interface thermal resistance.

Horizon 2020,InCell,High speed AFM imaging of molecular processes inside living cells,"Imaging the inside of living cells with single nanometre resolution has been a long-standing dream in bio-microscopy.   Direct observation of changes to molecular networks inside of living cells would revolutionize the way we study structural cell biology. Unfortunately, no such tool exists. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is the closest we have, to nanoscale functional imaging of cells in their native, fluid environment. However, it is limited to imaging the outside of the cell.  With InCell, I will remedy this by developing an AFM capable of imaging the inside of living cells. The approach is based on a microfabricated high speed AFM cantilever encased in a double barrel patch-clamp shell. The patch clamp shell seals onto the plasma membrane of the cell, so that the tip of the AFM cantilever can enter the cell without causing the cytosol to leak out. Parasitic interactions of the AFM tip with the cytosol will be subtracted from the cantilever deflection signal, using high speed photo-thermal off-resonance tapping (PT-ORT), a novel AFM mode we have recently developed in my lab. This allows the extraction of the true tip-sample interaction, even in viscous fluids. A dedicated InCell HS-AFM combined with confocal optical microscopy will be used to guide the InCell cantilever inside the cell to the area of interest. Using this minimally invasive technique we will study the formation of clathrin coated pits, a crucial part of endocytosis. By imaging for the first time the nanoscale dynamics of this process in living cells, we aim to answer fundamental questions about the clathrin coat assembly.

To achieve control over skyrmions, or more generally over the constituents of disordered elastic media (vortices in superconductors, domain walls in magnets to name a few), the fundamental interplay between short-range and long-range interactions, influenced by topological protection, disorder and confinement, has to be understood and manipulated.

Horizon 2020,TopSupra,Engineered Topological Superconductivity in van der Waals Heterostructures,"Topological matter is a new research focus with great perspectives. These are insulators with an inverted “negative” bandgap and a conducting surface state. While the surface state in a topological insulator (TI) is composed of chiral fermions carrying charge and spin, in topological superconductors it is pinned to zero energy due to particle-hole symmetry and composed of fermions that carry neither charge nor spin. In-stead, they are non-abelian fermions, Majorana and parafermions (MF/PF), that have been proposed for topological quantum computing. Evidence for MFs have been found in nanowires. However, the scaling-up challenge requires a platform in which networks of MFs can be realized. Here, we propose to use graphene-based van der Waals heterostructure for this purpose. The unprecedented versatility is enabled by combining high-mobility graphene with other layered materials, such as transition-metal dichalcogenide, few-layer ferromagnets and superconductors (SCs). This allows to design topological systems, e.g. the quantum spin, anomalous and valley Hall effect, by combining Zeeman energy, spin-orbit and pairing interaction. We will design 2D quantum matter using different approaches, including strain tuning and the dressing of the bandstructure by photon-fields (Floquet TI), and couple it to SCs to induce topological superconductivity.

The potential of ML in association with quantum mechanical (QM) and statistical mechanical (SM) methods has been shown, but the link has been rather superficial, due to the complex, interdisciplinary effort needed to combine the three approaches. Without full convergence, ML-powered simulations cannot address modern modeling challenges, which involve complex materials in realistic conditions, and require increasingly predictive accuracy. 
The objective of this project is to create a “plug and play” framework by which ML can be seamlessly combined with physics-based modeling, substituting individual steps of a QM calculation, or making direct predictions across complex SM workflows. Full integration of the three approaches will greatly extend the reach of atomistic simulations, and allow an insightful critical comparison of the role of inductive and deductive paradigms in theory and modeling. The development of an open-source software that unifies QM, SM and ML shall facilitate early adoption and broaden impact. We will demonstrate the benefits of our integrated framework through two challenging and compelling platform problems: (i) investigating stabilities and properties of flexible drug-like molecules and assemblies, and (ii) discovering fundamental structure-activity relationships of porous aluminosilicates for clean chemical technologies.
Critical knowledge gaps that will be filled include: (1) the description of long-range physics within the same conceptual framework that has been used for short-range interactions; (2) the symmetry-adapted representation of input and outputs of each step of a QM calculation; and (3) the rigorous characterization of SM ensembles to enable end-to-end predictions of equilibrium properties with uncertainty quantification.",Michele Ceriotti,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,101001890,ERC-2020-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE4 - Physical & Analytical Chemical Sciences,2020,44562,46387,1998015,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101001890,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,OptEIon,"Defect Engineering, Advanced Modelling and Characterization for Next Generation Opto-Electronic-Ionic Devices","Defects in semiconductor materials commonly deteriorate the performance of optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes. In the recently emerged and highly successful hybrid metal halide perovskite, some lattice defects are even mobile leading to mixed ionic-electronic conductivity. This and other outstanding properties (tunable bandgap, lower dimensional embodiments, solution processability) make the perovskite a very interesting material for research and application. At the same time, it suffers from various degradation processes, linked to these poorly understood ionic defects. The major questions are: Where and what are these defects? How are they formed and how can we control their movement?
OptEIon will provide answers to these questions.
Based on my expertise in the device physics and experience in perovskites I will proceed as follows: First, I will characterize the transient response of devices with different perovskite materials, different stoichiometry, partial pressure of constituents, temperature, etc. to find clear evidence for the nature of the mobile defects and their diffusion constant. Second, I will employ nano-scale characterization on cross sections of working devices to measure location and time evolution of defects causing recombination losses in solar cells. In addition to established measurement techniques, I will use tip-enhanced (near field) spectroscopic techniques, which can provide super-resolution imaging. Third, I will apply device simulation to examine the measurement results. I will furthermore evaluate how machine learning in combination with our physical model could be implemented to help analyse device data. Fourth, I will exploit the results by fabricating demonstrator memristor arrays that can be controlled by light.
The outcome will be more efficient and stable solar cells and novel optoelectronic devices such as memristors, which are supposed to herald a new era of neuromorphic computing.",Wolfgang Tress,Zurich University of Applied Sciences,Switzerland,-,851676,ERC-2019-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE4 - Physical & Analytical Chemical Sciences,2019,43983,46173,1980735,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/851676,Zurich University of Applied Sciences
Horizon 2020,PushQChem,Pushing Quantum Chemistry by Advancing Photoswitchable Catalysis,"This project exploits the synergy between the trending area of artificial molecular machines and cutting edge computational chemistry approaches. Specific emphasis is placed on photoswitchable catalysts, which respond to external stimuli with a conformational or configurational change. These controllable motions allow catalytic function to be turned ON/OFF in a switch type fashion by opening/hindering access of a substrate to a catalytic site. On one hand, the rich morphology and chemistry of these smart catalysts calls for computational insights and design principles that complement experiment and push the field forward. On the other hand, the inherent complexity of these highly fluxional molecules makes them perfect subjects for driving modern quantum chemistry out of its comfort zone. To benefit from this synergy, the latest innovations in quantum chemistry-based machine learning techniques will be combined with methods capable of thoroughly mapping the intricate chemistry of molecular actuators. Overall, we aim to bridge the gap between the current state-of-the-art, which has reached reasonable quantum chemical accuracy for rigid medium size organic molecules, and more challenging fluxional architectures. The proposed methodological toolbox will be applied to the field of smart catalysis where general strategies for improving the efficiencies and enhancing enantioselectivity will be formulated. Thus, this project involves exploiting a wide range of modern computational approaches to chemical tasks that are broadly relevant to flexible/switchable catalytic systems.

Horizon 2020,BALANCE,Mapping Dispersion Spectroscopically in Large Gas-Phase Molecular Ions,"We use IR spectroscopy of trapped ions in a cryogenic FT-ICR spectrometer to probe non-covalent, “dispersion” interactions in large, gas-phase molecular ions.  We will measure conformational equilibria by N-H frequency shifts, and correlate gas-phase IR frequency to the N-H-N bond angle in an ionic H-bond.  Substituents on “onium” cations can adopt various conformations, whose energies map interaction potentials.  Substituents on their proton-bound dimers interact non-covalently through dispersion forces, whose quantitative evaluation in large molecules has remained difficult despite dispersion becoming increasingly cited as a design principle in the construction of catalysts and materials.  The non-covalent interactions bend the N-H-N bond, leading to large shifts in the IR frequency.  The proton-bound dimer acts like a molecular balance where the non-covalent interaction, is set against the bending potential in an ionic hydrogen bond.  Despite encouragingly accurate calculations for small molecules, experimental benchmarks for large molecules in the gas phase remain scarce, and there is evidence that the good results for small molecules may not extrapolate reliably to large molecules.  The present proposal introduces a new experimental probe of non-covalent interactions, providing a sensitive test of the diverging results coming from various computational methods and other experiments.  The experiment must be done on isolated molecules in the gas phase, as previous work has shown that solvation substantially cancels out the attractive potential.  Accordingly, the proposed experimental design, which involves a custom-built spectrometer, newly available tunable IR sources, chemical synthesis of custom substrates, and quantum calculations up to coupled-cluster levels of theory, showcases how an interdisciplinary approach combining physical and organic chemistry can solve a fundamental problem that impacts how we understand steric effects in organic chemistry.",Peter Chen,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,832697,ERC-2018-ADG,Advanced Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE4 - Physical & Analytical Chemical Sciences,2018,43586,45777,2446125,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/832697,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,ProteinDynamics,Visualizing the Conformational Dynamics of Proteins by Time-Resolved Electron Microscopy,"The function of many proteins involves large-amplitude domain motions that occur on a timescale of microseconds to millisecond. In the absence of tools to directly observe these dynamics, our understanding of the function of proteins is necessarily incomplete and must frequently rely on extrapolation from known static structures. Here, the implementation of real-time imaging of single particle dynamics in liquid phase is proposed with both microsecond time resolution as well as near-atomic spatial resolution. The experimental approach builds on several recent technological advances, namely the advent of Time-Resolved (“Four-dimensional”) Electron Microscopy, graphene liquid cell technology, and direct electron detection cameras, which are combined with established single-particle reconstruction techniques in cryo-Electron Microscopy. Visualizing the conformational dynamics of proteins will fundamentally advance our understanding of these nanoscale machines and has the potential to greatly benefit biomedical applications.",Ulrich Joseph Lorenz,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,759145,ERC-2017-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE4 - Physical & Analytical Chemical Sciences,2017,43160,45169,2000000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/759145,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,ATTOLIQ,Attosecond X-ray spectroscopy of liquids,"Charge and energy transfer are the key steps underlying most chemical reactions and biological transformations. The purely electronic dynamics that control such processes take place on attosecond time scales. A complete understanding of these dynamics on the electronic level therefore calls for new experimental methods with attosecond resolution that are applicable to aqueous environments. We propose to combine the element sensitivity of X-ray spectroscopy with attosecond temporal resolution and ultrathin liquid microjets to study electronic dynamics of relevance to chemical, biological and photovoltaic processes. We will build on our recent achievements in demonstrating femtosecond time-resolved measurements in the water, attosecond pho-toelectron spectroscopy on a liquid microjet and measuring and controlling attosecond charge migration in isolated molecules. We will first concentrate on liquid water to study its electronic dynamics following outer-valence ionization, the formation pathway of the solvated electron and the time scales and intermolecular Coulombic decay following inner-valence or core-level ionization. Second, we will turn to solvated species and measure electronic dynamics and charge migration in solvated molecules, transition-metal complexes and pho-toexcited nanoparticles. These goals will be achieved by developing several innovative experimental tech-niques. We will develop a source of isolated attosecond pulses covering the water window (285-538 eV) and combine it with a flat liquid microjet to realize attosecond transient absorption in liquids. We will complement these measurements with attosecond X-ray emission spectroscopy, Auger spectroscopy and a novel hetero-dyne-detected variant of resonant inelastic Raman scattering, exploiting the large bandwidth that is naturally available from attosecond X-ray sources.",Hans Jakob Wörner,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,772797,ERC-2017-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE4 - Physical & Analytical Chemical Sciences,2017,43191,45016,2750000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/772797,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,eDrop,Droplet Photoelectron Imaging,"Angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy of aerosol droplets (“droplet photoelectron imaging”) is a novel approach to study fundamental aspects of the electron dynamics in liquids and across interfaces. Our recent proof-of-principle studies demonstrate that droplet photoelectron imaging not only complements, but also significantly extends the range of accessible information over established methods. Two aspects are unique to droplets: Firstly, the droplet size can be varied over a wide range from submicrons to microns. While large droplets provide overlap with liquid microjet and bulk studies, small droplets offer additional control by acting as efficient optical resonators. These optical cavity effects can be exploited to control where in the droplet the photoelectrons are generated; e.g. surface versus volume. Secondly, comprehensive information about photoelectron kinetic energy and angular distributions can be obtained fast and in a straightforward way by velocity map imaging.Building on our proof-of-principle studies, we propose to exploit the versatility of the droplet approach to address fundamental questions regarding electron dynamics in liquids and across interfaces: Can this new tool provide the missing data for low-energy electron scattering in water and other liquids and resolve the issue of the “universal curve”? How do slow electrons scatter across liquid-gas and buried liquid-liquid/solid interfaces and how does this depend on the composition and curvature of the interface? How is the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of electrons following above-band-gap excitation influenced by electron scattering and confinement effects? Low-energy electron scattering is a determining factor in radiation chemistry and biology and a central aspect of the solvated electron dynamics, while interfacial processes play a key role in atmospheric aerosols. Droplet photoelectron imaging opens up new ways to study such phenomena.",Ruth Signorell Luckhaus,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,786636,ERC-2017-ADG,Advanced Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE4 - Physical & Analytical Chemical Sciences,2017,43405,45961,2500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/786636,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,GLYCANAL,High-Throughput Cryogenic Spectroscopy for Glycan Analysis,"Glycans, or oligosaccharides, are ubiquitous in biological systems. Because they decorate the surface of cells, they play a key role in virtually all cellular recognition processes and are implicated in almost every major disease.  Despite their importance, the characterization of glycan primary structure lags far behind that of proteins and DNA because of their intrinsic isomeric complexity. The isomeric nature of the monosaccharide building blocks, the stereochemistry of the glycosidic bond, the possibility of multiple attachment points, and the occurrence of isomeric branched structures all make glycans difficult to analyze.

Although mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the most sensitive approaches for glycan analysis, it has difficulty to distinguish all these various types of isomerisms. Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) combined with MS has demonstrated some ability to identify glycan anomers and regioisomers, but cannot easily distinguish isomeric disaccharides, for example.

We have recently demonstrated that cryogenic infrared spectroscopy provides unique vibrational fingerprints of glycans that distinguishes all the various types of isomerism. When combined with simultaneous measurements of mass and ion mobility, these fingerprints can be tabulated in a database and used to identify a given glycan from a mixture. However, adding a spectroscopic dimension to ion mobility and mass measurements requires additional time, which hampers it use as an analytical tool. To use spectroscopic data for real-world glycan analysis, one must multiplex the measurement process and record the vibrational spectrum of many species simultaneously.

This project involves designing and constructing an instrument that combines state-of-the-art ion mobility separation, cryogenic ion spectroscopy, and time-of-flight mass spectrometry to perform high throughput analysis of glycan primary structure.  The success of this project would represent a tremendous breakthrough for glycoscience.

Horizon 2020,DEPO,Reversing Controlled Radical Polymerisation: Towards Complete Depolymerisation,"Controlled radical polymerisation has revolutionised the field of polymer chemistry by allowing access to the synthesis of a wide range of materials with controlled molecular weight, dispersity, architecture and end-group fidelity. Although thousands of papers have reported on optimising the polymerisation parameters, very few reports have focused on reversing controlled radical polymerisation. This is a significant oversight, as controlled depolymerisation has the potential not only to reveal intriguing avenues of research, but also to pave the way for promising applications including innovative polymer characterisation methodologies. The overall vision of DEPO is to develop a universal, quantitative and controlled depolymerisation of polymers (i.e. converting polymers back to the corresponding monomers) synthesised mainly by controlled radical polymerisation. Although this strategy will initially be developed for atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) systems, it will be expanded to include reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) and nitroxide-mediated polymerisation (NMP) protocols. Widely-used polymers synthesised by other methods such as polystyrene will also be modified to permit for depolymerisation. Importantly, this approach will operate at room temperature and will be applicable to a range of polymer classes and architectures (block copolymers, stars, etc.).

Horizon 2020,InActioN,Intracellular Action of DNA-based Nano-materials,"Self-organization of matter into structured architectures with emerging functionality is arguably the most important phenomenon to enable life. Unfortunately, human efforts to successfully engineer materials that control hierarchical order and achieve precise action in cells, have suffered from structural heterogeneity and limitations in functional precision. Immune pathways are prime examples of cascades where a finely balanced sequence of interactions decides between life-changing outcomes, varying from tolerance to active fight. Immune-modulating materials, therefore, would uniquely benefit from precision control over functionality. DNA-based nanomaterials have the potential to change our current bioengineering standards due to their inherent architectural uniformity and nanometer control of functionalization, allowing for a quantitative analysis of material parameters on cell activation.   The goal of this ERC proposal is to use structural geometry of DNA-based materials to provoke controlled intracellular manipulation of immune signaling via the hierarchical and spatial organization of constitutive DNA binding proteins. We create a circular paradox where DNA defines protein synthesis, yet protein function is controlled by self-organization following interaction with designer DNA. Our approach stands out in its controlled-by-nature strategy: 1) we exclusively use materials derived from cellular building blocks; that 2) respond to stimuli generated without artificial intervention, 3) that we quantify using pathway specific activation markers and 4) image via label-free microscopy to track inherent structural changes in physical material properties. We apply our approach on two important signaling pathways involved in immunology: TLR9 as Th1 trigger for vaccine adjuvants and innate cGAS inhibition to fight autoimmunity. Using spatial organization as foundation for geometry-based immune-engineering will revolutionize the design of novel immune-modulating materials.",Maartje Martina Cornelia Bastings,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,948334,ERC-2020-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE5 - Synthetic Chemistry & Materials,2020,44228,46418,1499755,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/948334,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,VELCROProtein,Biologically Inspired Molecular Adhesives towards Multifunctional Biomaterials and Microreactors,"Recombinant proteins, including enzymes and antibodies, have revolutionized many sectors of biochemistry and biotechnology. In this project I propose a groundbreaking technology to control the supramolecular assembly of proteins in space and time to better mimic cellular organization and create a next generation of protein “living” materials for biocatalysis and medicine. 

The core idea is to mimic cellular multiprotein assemblies and microreactors on the bench, by compartmentalizing multiple proteins in space. Increasing evidence indicates that cells can coordinate crucial functions by forming membrane-less compartments via liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins and nucleic acids. Most of the proteins involved in this process consist of globular regions and disordered domains, which are enriched in specific aminoacids and pilot highly controlled self-assembly. In this project we will conjugate functional globular proteins with sequences that mimic the disordered biological domains and act as “molecular Velcros”, thereby coupling biochemical functions with phase separation in space and time. Using a combination of microfluidic technology and in silico analysis, we will develop sequences capable to control not only the dynamic process of phase separation but also the phenotype of the resulting compartments, including selective recruitment of molecules, physical properties and response to specific switches. 

This project will deliver adaptive compartments with unprecedented control of composition, environment, biochemical function and stimulus-responsiveness, going towards the development of networks of open microreactors, superior enzymes for green chemistry as well as smart materials for drug delivery. Moreover, the results will generate new knowledge on natural supramolecular structures that are associated with both functional biology and aberrant aggregates involved in devastating disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

Horizon 2020,X-Fold StereoGen,Catalyst Control over X-Fold Stereogenicity,"Catalytic, stereoselective methodologies to study the control over the configuration of stereogenic elements with three- four-, five- and six-fold stereoisomerism are proposed. Previous catalyst-stereocontrolled methods allowed the differentiation of a twofold number of stereoisomers for any given stereogenic element. It is thus anticipated that expanding the stereogenicity in stereoselective catalysis represents a significant advance for the field. The reunification of conformational analysis and stereoisomerism in organic synthesis is expected to provide an improved conceptual framework. Traditionally, stereogenic elements are considered to generate a doubled number of possible stereoisomers, which are assigned with standard stereochemical descriptors such as R and S. The overall number of possible stereoisomers in a molecule with a set of stereogenic elements (n) is thus commonly predicted as 2^n. This binary stereochemical understanding of stereoisomerism represents a current basis for organic synthesis and a wide range of bioactive compounds critical for our health care are skillfully prepared by controlling the configuration of desired stereoisomers. Control over stereogenic elements that generate more than a twofold number of possible stereoisomers thus dramatically extents the scope of current stereoselective catalysis and organic synthesis. 1: The underpinnings of conformational analysis and the catalyst-stereocontrolled synthesis will be conceptually unequivocally reunited. 2: The uncharted setting of catalyst control over three-, four-, five- and six-fold stereogenicity will be established by the development of versatile synthetic methodologies. 3: Novel molecular architectures featuring unique chemical topologies will be assessible, representing unexplored chemical designs for a broad range of applications.  4: A divergent catalysis approach will be explored, utilizing common substrates for several stereoisomeric products with extended stereogenicity.",Christof Sparr,University of Basel,Switzerland,-,101002471,ERC-2020-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE5 - Synthetic Chemistry & Materials,2020,44317,46142,1999266,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101002471,University of Basel
Horizon 2020,HEINE,Hybrid Electrocatalysts Inspired by the Nitrogenase Enzyme,"Artificial nitrogen reduction to ammonia using the Haber-Bosch process directly supports half of the global food production and accounts for 2% of the global energy consumption. This large consumption of energy originates mostly from the use of H2 (derived from fossil fuels) as a reductant and from the high pressure and temperature required to undertake the Haber-Bosch process. 
Electrochemical synthesis of ammonia, using a proton and electron source combined with an electrocatalyst at room temperature to reduce N2, thus presents an appealing, energy-efficient alternative. However, despite years of research, the few currently available catalysts have very limited efficiency in N2 electroreduction. 
Drawing inspiration from biochemistry and using the tools of coordination chemistry, catalysis and surface chemistry, this project will explore an original strategy to develop catalysts for the reduction of N2 inspired by the nitrogenase enzyme. 
Motivated by the recent discovery of two unique moieties in the nitrogenase cofactor – the presence of a µ6-carbide moiety and a Mo(III) center – and of the increased understanding of substrate pathways in the nitrogenase protein structure, the goal of  HEINE is to design new hybrid catalysts based on the immobilisation of accurate mimics of the nitrogenase active sites onto heterogeneous supports used to generate properties analogous of the protein scaffold (hydrophobicity, proton relays, etc.). This will provide us with novel ways to develop functional electrocatalysts for N2 reduction in ambient conditions, combining the activity of traditional solid-state systems, with the selectivity of molecular catalysts. 
By identifying and reproducing the parameters responsible for the unique activity of nitrogenase enzymes,  HEINE will yield invaluable information on nature’s routes to N2 reduction and will pave the way towards a new generation of electrocatalysts able to promote this reaction.

Horizon 2020,ExploDProteins,Exploiting the DNA damage response to induce degradation of proteins,"Here I propose to use small molecules to degrade proteins specifically around sites of DNA damage by using the damage itself as a homing signal. The approach will create new ways to study DNA damage, but will also offer translational possibilities in cancer. Cancer cells are often acutely sensitive to DNA damage because they have one or more faulty DNA damage response (DDR) pathways – a feature that makes them highly dependent on their remaining DNA repair systems. We will pioneer two novel and related chemical approaches for selectively killing cancer cells by modulating DDR pathways with bifunctional DNA damaging molecules. We will do this by reprogramming E3 ligases. E3 ligases are modular multi-protein complexes that destabilize cellular proteins by catalysing the formation of polyubiquitin chains on its substrates, which serve as a signal for proteasomal degradation. A recent revolutionary advance in chemical biology is to use small molecules to reprogram the protein degradation specificity of E3 ligases. By degrading proteins instead of inhibiting them, these small molecules achieve levels of functional modulation typically only possible with genetic techniques. We are inspired by this new protein degradation technology, but will take it in a new direction. Chemical damage of DNA recruits E3 ligases as well as critical DDR proteins in preparation for DNA repair. We will invent a new generation of small molecule protein degradation catalysts by repurposing these natural responses to DNA damage.
We will accomplish our goal with three aims:
Aim 1: Use DNA damage as a homing signal for induced protein degradation
Aim 2: Use direct repair of DNA damage by the repair protein MGMT to promote the degradation of other proteins
Aim 3: Promote pleiotropic protein degradation by recruiting broadly acting E3 ligases to sites of DNA damage

Horizon 2020,METABOLIGHT,Optical imaging platform to unravel metabolic reprogramming of cancer: a path for improved treatments,"Recent investigations revealed that cancer tissue possesses several important metabolic features, such as differential utilization of many essential metabolites. This phenomenon is now referred to as ""metabolic reprogramming"" and is known to be required for malignant transformation, tumor development, invasion and metastasis. Its complex and dynamic nature has been recognized as one of the major challenges for effective cancer treatment. Therefore, a better understanding of metabolic dependencies in specific tumor types can provide a path for improved cancer treatments.

However, no efficient methodologies currently exist that allow noninvasive imaging and quantification of the uptake of essential metabolites in animal models of disease. Current strategies rely on either nuclear imaging techniques such as PET/SPECT/MRI or endpoint ex vivo quantification of metabolites (ex. MS). All of these methods have significant limitations, resulting in a lack of understanding of tumor metabolism and, consequently, poor predictability and efficacy of cancer therapies.

To address the unmet need for nutrient uptake imaging tools, we propose to develop a novel platform based on a combination of versatile “click” chemistry reactions with noninvasive, ultrasensitive bioluminescent imaging techniques. The applications of the novel platform will focus on tumor uptake measurements of glucose, fatty acids, amino acids, and nucleosides previously reported to play important roles in cancer metabolism. We will then use this platform to investigate the metabolic reprogramming of different liver cancers, which may lead to the generation of novel, effective treatments; therefore, this novel platform has high clinical applicability.

Horizon 2020,SPACE4AMPS,Chemical Space for Antimicrobials on a Peptide Basis,"Multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria represent a global public health threat against which new drugs are urgently needed. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), mostly derived from naturally occurring linear or cyclic peptides, can contribute to solving the problem. AMPs are already in clinical use, do not easily lead to resistance, and can rely on a strong manufacturing sector and established protocols for clinical development. However, most AMPs are degraded by proteases and have poor pharmacokinetics.
SPACE4AMPS aims to identify new AMPs with diverse peptide chain topologies and building blocks and with the following characteristics: i) Broad activity spectrum, ii) High activity, iii) Low probability for induced resistance, iv) Low proteolysis, v) Better pharmacokinetics.
To reach its goal SPACE4AMPS will create computational tools to explore the extremely vast chemical space of large molecules such as peptides and natural products, which now lies within reach of the latest computer hardware developments. 
To better understand antimicrobial drugs, we will design a molecular fingerprint relating antimicrobial activity to molecular structure and use it to draw a tree-map of the antimicrobial chemical space. We will enrich this map with new compounds from generative models using neural networks. 
To identify new AMPs, we will use a genetic algorithm carrying out cycles of molecule generation and similarity calculations to select cyclic peptides and peptide dendrimers including lipidated, peptoid (N-alkyl glycines) and N-methylated residues, synthesize and test these molecules against MDR bacteria, fungi and parasites, screen actives for toxicity, and study their structure and mode of action.

Horizon 2020,HDPROBES,"Photoactivatable Sensors and Blinking Dyes for Live-Cell, Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy
","In this proposal, we introduce two new families of probes for live-cell super-resolution microscopy. The first class comprises small-molecule fluorescent sensors for detecting short-lived, small signaling molecules and active enzymes with single-molecule resolution. The spatiotemporal confinement of biological reactive molecules has been hypothesized to regulate various pathological and physiological processes, but the lack of tools to observe directly these microdomains of biochemical activity has precluded the investigation of these mechanisms. The ability to detect small signaling agents and active enzymes with nanometric resolution in intact live specimens will allow us to study the role of compartmentalization in intracellular signaling at an unprecedented resolution. Our studies will focus on detecting elusive reactive oxygen and nitrogen species directly at their sites of endogenous production. We will also investigate the subcellular distribution of protease activity, focusing on its role in non-apoptotic signaling.The second class of probes encompasses a palette of fluorescent dyes that switch continuously between dark and emissive forms. This dynamic equilibrium will enable the localization of single molecules in a densely labeled field without the need to apply toxic light for photoactivation. Based on a novel switching mechanism, we will prepare dyes of various emission wavelengths that blink in a controlled way. These dyes will allow us to perform, for the first time, super-resolution, multicolor, time-lapse imaging of live specimens over long time. Initial studies will focus on tracking a transcription factor that migrates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus to initiate a cellular stress response upon protein misfolding.

The recent success of lead halide perovskites in optoelectronics inspires broader exploration of the chemistry and photophysics of MHs. The clear objective is to determine factors controlling the spectral widths and emission peak wavelengths, Stokes shifts, radiative lifetimes, and quantum efficiencies. In addition to the need to discover new chemically robust and nontoxic MH emitters, there is also a critical need to engineer material morphologies suitable for specific applications (e.g., thin films, nanocrystals, composites, etc.) Ensuring the thermal and environmental stabilities are especially important efforts. SCALE-HALO will therefore encompass the chemical engineering of MHs at the atomic scale (e.g., new compounds), nanoscale (e.g., synthesis of nanostructures and their surface chemistry), and mesoscale (e.g., nanostructure superlattices and composites). Furthermore, modern exploratory syntheses will be accelerated with automated high-throughput methods (e.g., robotics and microfluidics). The characterization toolbox for probing the local atomistic structure will be expanded with multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The individual and collective optical properties of MH nanostructures and their periodic assemblies will be established and rationalized. Toward diverse real-world applications, first trials will be undertaken to evaluate the potentials of novel MH materials for LCD displays, solid-state lighting and light-emitting diodes.",Maksym Kovalenko,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,819740,ERC-2018-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE5 - Synthetic Chemistry & Materials,2018,43617,45626,1999950,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/819740,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,OLECAT,Development of Stereoselective Olefin Functionalization Methods,"The ability toThe ability to readily access small-molecule building blocks at will has important consequences for the discovery and development of novel medicines and materials.  It is particularly beneficial when the chemical methods are convenient while at the same time economically and environmentally tenable and sustainable. We are especially interested in catalytic processes that are easily executed and utilize readily available starting materials to produce optically active products with high regio, chemo, diastereo, and enantioselectivity.  
The proposal aims to discover, develop, and study a collection of enantioselective olefin functionalization reactions that provide access to useful building blocks, such as amines, azides, hydrazines, nitriles, alcohols, involving acyclic, cyclic and bicyclic structures. The catalyst will be derived from earth abundant metals, such as Fe, Mn, and Co and incorporate novel chiral ligands. The study includes the design and preparation of two structural classes of novel, chiral boric acids that are expected to serve as catalyst for the enantioselective functionalization of unsaturated carboxylic acids and boronic acids. 
The methods are expected to substantially impact the development of novel strategies for complex molecule synthesis.  In this regard, we propose to use the catalysts form this study to convert dienes and trienes into polyols with characteristic stereochemical and oxidation patterns found in bioactive agents, including pharma- and nutraceuticals (carnitine). Such advances enable new approaches that go beyond the well-established methods such as aldol/allylation for the preparation of stereochemically complex fragments. Catalysts will also be developed that convert acyclic olefinic alcohols and amines into optically active, saturated furans, pyrans, pyrrolidines, and piperidines.  The implementation of the various catalytic methods in complex settings enables efficient, convergent routes to bioactive agents.

Horizon 2020,ShuttleCat,Shuttle Catalysis for Reversible Molecular Construction,"Homogeneous catalysis is one of the pillars of modern chemical synthesis because it enables the sustainable preparation of molecules that find applications in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science. However, many catalytic reactions use hazardous reagents, are unpractical on laboratory-scale or limited in scope. Moreover, while a relatively broad set of catalytic reactions are available to construct chemical bonds, methods to cleave those, which could find applications in biomass and waste valorization, are rare.  Inspired by the synthetic power of other metal-catalyzed reversible reactions, such as transfer hydrogenation and alkene metathesis, I herein describe a groundbreaking approach to homogeneous catalysis that makes use of a novel paradigm called “shuttle catalysis”, defined as the catalytic reversible transfer of chemical moieties between two molecules, to construct and deconstruct organic compounds. The first part of the proposal describes the invention of reversible catalytic functionalization reactions of alkenes following this principle. The second part addresses the challenge of developing safer catalytic carbonylation and decarbonylation reactions that do not use nor release toxic carbon monoxide gas. Finally, the last part proposes to apply the shuttle catalysis concept to the invention of unprecedented C–X (X = P, O, S, N) bond metathesis reactions. This new approach to catalysis has the potential to revolutionize the preparation, and streamline the discovery, of numerous important molecules with applications across the molecular sciences. Importantly, in order to mitigate the high risks inherent to such a groundbreaking approach, we have collected preliminary results to demonstrate the feasibility of each of the proposed subprojects.",Bill Morandi,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,757608,ERC-2017-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE5 - Synthetic Chemistry & Materials,2017,43101,44926,1485000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/757608,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,SeleCHEM,Overcoming the Selectivity Challenge in Chemistry and Chemical Biology via Innovative Tethering Strategies,"In the last two centuries, synthetic organic chemistry has undergone an unprecedented revolution. The ability to understand and modify the molecular structure of matter has changed our life in many areas, such as medicine, agriculture or commodity materials. These major successes gave the impression that synthetic chemistry is a mature field. However, this impression is completely misleading, as current synthetic methods still lack the selectivity needed for the modification of complex molecules. Both selecting between different reactive groups and functionalizing inert bonds in their presence represent formidable challenges. In this project, we propose to develop highly selective “molecular tethers” for the functionalization of both natural/synthetic organic compounds and biomolecules. The envisioned tethers are bifunctional small organic molecules having three fundamental properties:1) A “biting end” with unique reactivity to be selectively installed in situ onto naturally occurring thiols, alcohols and amines. We will use tethers based on acetals and hypervalent iodine reagents.2) A “functional end”, whose reactivity can be revealed “at will” to functionalize bonds that cannot be accessed with the current state of the art of synthetic chemistry, especially inert C-H and C=C bonds.3) Being traceless, meaning that they can be removed easily once the desired functionalization has been achieved.The main impact of this project will be in fundamental synthetic organic chemistry, as it will contribute to overcoming major selectivity hurdles in the functionalization of complex molecules. It will therefore result in faster progress in all the fields depending on synthetic molecules, such as medicine, agriculture or materials. A more efficient functionalization of biomolecules will allow us to soften the boundaries between synthetic chemistry and biology, leading to major progress in our understanding of living systems and our ability to modify them.",Jerome Waser,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,771170,ERC-2017-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE5 - Synthetic Chemistry & Materials,2017,43466,45291,2000000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/771170,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,DistOpt-BydWorstCase,Distributed Optimization Beyond Worst-Case Topologies,"Modern systems are increasingly dezentralized and massively distributed computations play a vital role in the systems of the future. This project aims to advance the foundational aspects of distributed computing, particularly MessagePassing algorithms for optimization problems. 

The strong shift towards distributed systems also lead to a flurry of works on such algorithms -- many optimization problems now have distributed algorithms with optimal worst-case performance guarantees. Generally, these guarantees cannot be improved because they match unconditional impossibility results, which prove severe limitations on the performance of distributed algorithms in some (pathological) network topologies. Real world networks, however, are never worst-case and do not share the limiting bottleneck characteristics of these pathological topologies. In fact, there is no known barrier for ultra-fast polylogarithmic-round distributed algorithms on any network of interest. This leaves an exponential gap between current worst-case-optimal algorithms and what is likely possible in many, if not all, real-world settings.

Motivated by this, this project provides a program for a general toolbox and theory for MessagePassing optimization algorithms that go beyond worst-case topologies. The main and guiding high-risk high-gain goal is the development of universally optimal distributed algorithms, which are competitive with the best algorithm on any given topology. This would constitute the strongest possible form of algorithmically adjusting to non-worst-case topologies. A detailed program with many concrete and smaller stepping stones towards this ambitious breakthrough objective is provided. Many of the novel questions stemming from this program and proposal are highly interdisciplinary, crossing boundaries between information theory, distributed computing, topological graph theory, and other parts of theoretical computer science, and are fundamental and interesting in their own right.",Bernhard Haeupler,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,949272,ERC-2020-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE6 - Computer Science & Informatics,2020,44075,46053,1540000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/949272,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,UNRAVEL,Unraveling the Physics of Light at Scale,"Earth climate research crucially depends on measurements of the atmospheric distribution of CO2, which is largely obtained using satellites. But satellites cannot directly measure CO2—they capture photographs at different wavelengths that must be mathematically processed to obtain this information. Current methods for solving this inverse problem are unaware of many aspects of the images including topography, cloud shape, shadowing, etc. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified the resulting errors as the main cause of discrepancies between different climate sensitivity models.

This proposal in the area of computer graphics introduces methods for inverting the physics of light at unprecedented scales that will address these inaccuracies. However, the scope of our contribution extends far beyond climate modeling: it will have a revolutionary impact on all scientific disciplines that involve the analysis of images, including biology, computer vision, architecture, and many others.

In this project,

- we will establish the first  framework for inverting light simulations with billions of parameters.

To demonstrate its generality, and to realize the impact of this framework, we will specialize it to three areas:

- we will develop the first invertible atmospheric optics simulator for earth climate monitoring that accounts for 3D structures, addressing severe inaccuracies of current  methods. 

- we will create an invertible virtual microscope that will open the door to fundamentally new reconstruction techniques in the area of biology.

- we will design architectural light simulations that are able to adapt buildings so that they make ideal use of naturally available daylight. 

To achieve these goals, we must unravel the messy physics of light to either reveal or control the properties of visible and invisible objects. Our approach will solve this impossible-seeming problem at large scales with substantial impact across disciplines.",Wenzel Jakob,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,948846,ERC-2020-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE6 - Computer Science & Informatics,2020,44805,46630,1496955,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/948846,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,MYCLOTH,Sustainable Algorithmic Modeling of Personalized Garments,"Clothing is a fundamental and indispensable part of human existence, and dressing people has tremendous societal, economical, and environmental impact. The clothing industry today is one of the most polluting and wasteful industries in terms of natural and human resources: 50% of all manufactured garments are imminently destined for landfill or incineration. The majority of clothes are manufactured by human labor in the developing world, often in excruciating conditions due to immense pressure to produce cheaply and quickly for ""fast fashion"". The low consumer costs are subsidized by harming the environment and the human workers in the apparel manufacturing industry. 

A fundamental, radical change is required to the way clothes are designed, manufactured and delivered to consumers, generating value and attachment via quality instead of quantity and curbing toxic overproduction. The goal of this project is to bring transformative technological advances in geometric modeling and optimization of personalized, custom-fitted and fabricable garments in order to crucially support this change. To reach our goals, we must break away from traditional shape representations and modeling pipelines and develop a dedicated mathematical and algorithmic foundation for digital cloth and garment modeling. Our envisioned theoretical basis of the digital garment shape space will on the one hand facilitate a novel interactive modeling framework to support apparel designers in the creative task of template garment design in a reality-faithful manner, and on the other hand serve as the enabling foundation for automated, algorithmic garment personalization to perfectly fit any human body model. In stark contrast to current practice of standardized confection sizes, our framework will enable on-demand fabrication of custom-tailored clothing while being inclusive of the full diversity range of human shapes, and anticipate the proliferation of digital garment fabrication technology.",Olga Sorkine Hornung,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,101003104,ERC-2020-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE6 - Computer Science & Informatics,2020,44228,46053,2000000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101003104,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,PLAZA,Post-Quantum Lattice-Based Zero-Knowledge,"The world is on a seemingly irreversible path towards a more privacy-oriented and decentralized mode of
storing and operating on data. A lot of this transformation is being enabled by advanced cryptography that’s
designed to cut out the need for trusted third parties that we rely on today. The effect of this transformation
is a more secure and, at the same time, a more efficient way of interaction in which the manual checks and
audits are instead embedded into the cryptographic protocols themselves. Another technological development
that’s on the horizon is a general-purpose quantum computer, whose utility comes from the fact that it will
be able to solve some problems considerably faster than a classical computer. Because of the multitude of
its positive scientific applications, building such a computer is being vigorously pursued by governments and
private companies. The main negative consequence of quantum computing is that it breaks most of the
cryptography that’s crucial to the privacy transformation.

The main ingredient of privacy-centric cryptography is a zero-knowledge proof for showing knowledge
of an x satisfying f(x) = y without revealing anything else about x. The most compact zero-knowledge
proofs currently rely on the hardness of various mathematical assumptions which are no longer difficult in
the presence of quantum computers. The central objective of the PLAZA project will be to create practical
zero-knowledge proofs that can withstand quantum attacks by basing them on the hardness of lattice problems.
Lattice problems are a very promising set of assumptions upon which to base cryptography and they
are currently being used to create the most efficient quantum-resistant encryption and signature schemes.
Creating more complex, but still practical, lattice-based schemes has so far proved to be a major challenge

Horizon 2020,PSAP,Productive Spatial Accelerator Programming,"We propose a productive and efficient programming model to overcome the challenges posed by the end of Moore’s law. Our model bases on a fundamentally new spatial viewpoint that considers the computational structure of applications. The growth of the computing industry as well as the development of society at large has relied for 50 years on an exponential scaling law that is now coming to an end. The combination of multiple specialized components into a fundamentally heterogeneous system is one of the most promising approaches that drives the IT industry. Latest advances in computer architecture and silicon design enable cost-effective specialized accelerators. Those range from single-purpose designs, such as deep neural network chips, to general purpose graphics processing units and are combined into complex systems. However, programming these heterogeneous spatial systems that range from single systems on chip to million-core supercomputers is a fundamental challenge of our time. Prevalent parallel programming abstractions largely ignore the structure of the computation and guide programmers to design threads of execution that are scheduled to the machine. We depart from this temporal model to a spatial formulation where we express programs as parametric graphs that are mapped as first-class objects by a human-guided compilation system. We ensure productivity by designing a Python-based frontend and integrate the system with modern web technology. Our programming, compilation, and tuning system will substantially advance the state of the art in computing by supporting the graphical mapping of program graphs to spatial accelerators. We will demonstrate our methods on three challenging real-world applications in important domains. We strongly believe that, without holistic spatial programming, the growing complexity and inefficiency of heterogeneous programming will create a scaling wall that will severely limit our future computational capabilities.",Torsten Hoefler,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,101002047,ERC-2020-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE6 - Computer Science & Informatics,2020,44562,46387,1980917,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101002047,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,AlgoHex,Algorithmic Hexahedral Mesh Generation,"Digital geometry representations are nowadays a fundamental ingredient of many applications, as for instance CAD/CAM, fabrication, shape optimization, bio-medical engineering and numerical simulation. Among volumetric discretizations the ""holy grail"" are hexahedral meshes, i.e. a decomposition of the domain into conforming cube-like elements. For simulations they offer accuracy and efficiency that cannot be obtained with alternatives like tetrahedral meshes, specifically when dealing with higher-order PDEs. So far, automatic hexahedral meshing of general volumetric domains is a long-standing, notoriously difficult and open problem.  Our main goal is to develop algorithms for  automatic hexahedral meshing of general volumetric domains that are (i) robust, (ii) scalable and (iii) offer precise control on regularity, approximation error and element sizing/anisotropy.   Our approach is designed to replicate the success story of recent integer-grid map based algorithms for 2D quadrilateral meshing. The underlying methodology offers the essential global view on the problem that was lacking in previous attempts. Preliminary results of integer-grid map hexahedral meshing are promising and a breakthrough is in reach.  We identified five challenges that need to be addressed in order to reach practically sufficient hexahedral mesh generation. These challenges have partly been resolved in 2D, however, the solutions do not generalize to 3D due to the increased mathematical complexity of 3D manifolds. Nevertheless, with our experience in developing and evaluating the 2D techhiques, we identified the key properties that are necessary for success and accordingly propose novel volumetric counterparts that will be developed in the AlgoHex project.",David Bommes,University of Bern,Switzerland,-,853343,ERC-2019-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE6 - Computer Science & Informatics,2019,43862,45869,1482156,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/853343,University of Berne
Horizon 2020,CodeSan,Code Sanitization for Vulnerability Pruning and Exploitation Mitigation,"Despite massive efforts in securing software, about 60 security bugs are publicly reported each month. Systems software is prone to low level bugs caused by undefined behavior (memory corruption, type confusion, or API confusion). Exploits abuse undefined behavior to execute attacker specified code, or to leak information. We propose code sanitization (CodeSan), a comprehensive approach to improve code quality. CodeSan will sanitize software by (i) automating bug discovery during development through software testing and (ii) protecting deployed software through reflective mitigations. CodeSan trades formal completeness for practical scalability in three steps: First, policy-based sanitization makes undefined behavior (through violations of memory safety, type safety, or API flow safety) explicit and detectable given concrete test inputs. Second, automatic test case generation increases testing coverage for large programs without the need for pre-existing test cases, enabling broader and automated use of policy-based sanitization. Third, for deployed software, reflective mitigations place runtime checks precisely where they are needed based on data-flow and control-flow coverage from our testing efforts. CodeSan complements formal approaches by protecting software that is currently out of reach due to its size, complexity, or low level nature.

CodeSan is a compelling, comprehensive, and adaptive approach to thoroughly address undefined behavior for complex software. The three proposed thrusts complement each other naturally and will immediately guard large software systems such as Google Chromium, Mozilla Firefox, the Android system, or the Linux kernel, making them resilient against attacks.

In line with PI Payer’s track record on open sourcing his group’s research artifacts on cast sanitization, transformative fuzzing, or control-flow hijacking mitigations, all prototypes produced during CodeSan will be released as open-source.",Mathias Payer,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,850868,ERC-2019-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE6 - Computer Science & Informatics,2019,43891,46081,1499970,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/850868,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,DEVINTA,An Artificial Assistant for Software Developers,"Software development, also due to the complexity of software systems, is tackled by collaborating teams of people. For example, in pair programming two developers share a single workstation: One writes code, while the other reviews it and proposes ideas for improvement. While interacting with teammates is the preferred means to obtain help, their availability may fall short and they might not always have a solution at hand. To address this problem, recommender systems for developers have been proposed in the form of applications providing information items considered valuable for a given task and context (e.g., recommending documentation useful to understand a code component). However, these recommenders can hardly be considered as a valid alternative to teammates since they are not proactive, do not support the developer in a wide variety of tasks, do not adapt their recommendations to the developer’s profile, and fall short in having meaningful interactions with the developer (e.g., they are not able to answer developers’ questions).  Given the advances in artificial intelligence, the vision that one day a developer's teammate is a machine does not seem far-fetched anymore. The DEVINTA project aims at making this future a reality, introducing models and techniques serving as the basis for the first artificial assistant supporting developers in their everyday activities. The assistant helps in (i) comprehending unfamiliar code via source code to natural language translation; (ii) writing code faster, providing predictive feature implementation, meaning the ability to infer the feature the developer is implementing and automatically complete it; and (iii) improve code quality, performing online code review while the developer types the code, timely catching bugs and suboptimal implementation choices and providing solutions for them.

Horizon 2020,SyNET,From Network Verification to Synthesis: Breaking New Ground in Network Automation,"Nearly half of Japan without Internet for hours; thousands of airline passengers grounded; 600+ emergency calls not received. These are just three recent illustrations of the consequences of human-induced network misconfigurations. Such errors are caused by a fundamental gap: distilling the high-level requirements network operators have in mind into complex, low-level device configurations. In 2018, network operators are still trying to bridge this gap manually.

The goal of this proposal is to address this gap by automatically synthesizing low-level configurations out of high-level requirements. This is a hard, inter-disciplinary challenge requiring development of new fundamental methods spanning multiple scientific fields including computer networks, programming languages, and probabilistic reasoning. Our vision is akin to program synthesis, a new programming paradigm in which “one tells the computer what to do, not how to do it”.

We propose to address this challenge via three work packages: (i) user-aware synthesis where we develop techniques to facilitate how operators communicate their intents and define the space of configurations to search over; (ii) robustness-aware synthesis where we develop synthesis techniques that can enforce probabilistic properties (e.g., minimum reliability level) in uncertain network environments; and (iii) performance-aware synthesis where we develop methods to synthesize more performant configurations (e.g., to make the network converge faster).

We believe SyNET will trigger a paradigm shift and spearhead the next generation of network management tools blending formal methods, probabilistic models, and user-intuitive interfaces. By alleviating the need to configure networks, SyNET promises to avoid the vast majority of downtimes plaguing today’s networks and to make tomorrow’s networks more flexible and, ultimately, more efficient.",Laurent Vanbever,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,851809,ERC-2019-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE6 - Computer Science & Informatics,2019,43770,45961,1500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/851809,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,3DPBio,Computational Models of Motion for Fabrication-aware Design of Bioinspired Systems,"Bridging the fields of Computer Animation and Computational Fabrication, this proposal will establish the foundations for algorithmic design of physical structures that can generate lifelike movements. Driven by embedded actuators, these types of structures will enable an abundance of possibilities for a wide array of real-world technologies: animatronic characters whose organic motions will enhance their ability to awe, entertain and educate; soft robotic creatures that are both skilled and safe to be around; patient-specific prosthetics and wearable devices that match the soft touch of the human body, etc. Recent advances in additive manufacturing (AM) technologies are particularly exciting in this context, as they allow us to create designs of unparalleled geometric complexity using a constantly expanding range of materials. And if past developments are an indication, within the next decade we will be able to fabricate physical structures that approach, at least at the macro scale, the functional sophistication of their biological counterparts. However, while this unprecedented capability enables fascinating opportunities, it also leads to an explosion in the dimensionality of the space that must be explored during the design process. As AM technologies keep evolving, the gap between ""what we can produce"" and ""what we can design"" is therefore rapidly growing.

To effectively leverage the extraordinary design possibilities enabled by AM, 3DPBio will develop the computational and mathematical foundations required to study a fundamental scientific question: how are physical deformations, mechanical movements and overall functional capabilities governed by geometric shape features, material compositions and the design of compliant actuation systems?

Horizon 2020,MIAMI,Machine Learning-based Market Design,"Market designers study how to set the ""rules of a marketplace"" such that the market works well.  However, markets are getting increasingly complex such that designing good market mechanisms ""by hand"" is often infeasible, in particular when certain design desiderata (such as efficiency, strategyproofness, or fairness) are in conflict with each other. Moreover, human agents are boundedly-rational: already in small domains, they are best modeled as having incomplete preferences, because they may only know a ranking or the values of their top choices. In combinatorial domains, the number of choices grows exponentially, such that it quickly becomes impossible for an agent to report its full valuation, even if it had complete preferences. In this ERC grant proposal, we propose to combine techniques from ""machine learning"" with ""market design"" to address these challenges.First, we propose to develop a new approach we call ""Universal Automated Mechanism Design (U-AMD)"" via Deep Learning. In contrast to prior (ML-based) AMD work, we explicitly aim to train the ML algorithm to exploit regularities in the mechanism design space. This will bring about a paradigm shift in automated mechanism design, as it removes the limitation to single fixed settings present in prior work and enables us to generalize across settings. Second, we propose the ""Design of Machine Learning-based Mechanisms."" These are mechanisms that use machine learning internally to achieve good efficiency and incentives even when agents have incomplete knowledge about their own preferences.In addition to pushing the scientific boundaries of market design research, this ERC project will also have an immediate impact on practical market design.

Horizon 2020,PERDY,Perceptually-Driven Optimizations of Graphics Content for Novel Displays,"Displays play a vital role in many professional and personal activities. They are a crucial interface between a user and the digital world in tasks involving visualization and interaction with digital data. The abilities of new display technologies regarding reproduction of important visual cues, such as binocular disparity, accommodation, or motion parallax, outperform the capabilities of methods for optimizing graphics content to match the requirements of particular hardware designs. This leads to a poor visual quality and massive computational overhead, which hamper the adoption of novel displays. I argue that there are significant gaps between hardware, computational techniques, and understanding of human perception, which prevents taking full advantage of these technologies.To overcome these limitations, I and my team will combine hardware, computation, and perception into a unique platform where the capabilities of displays and quality requirements are represented in a shared space. The basis for our project will be in-depth understanding of human perception. Our experiments will focus on three aspects: (1) investigation of perceptual limits across a wide field of view, (2) involving all visual cues, and (3) establishing optimal trade-offs between different quality aspects. We will build efficient computational models that will predict perceived quality and enable perceptual optimizations to drive new content adaptation techniques.This project will contribute display-specific perceptual optimizations of graphics content to match the requirements of human perception. It will address the key aspects of portable devices such as energy efficiency and visual quality. Our experiments and modeling of human perception will provide crucial insights into new hardware developments.

Horizon 2020,BDE,Beyond Distance Estimates: A New Theory of Heuristics for State-Space Search,"Many problems in computer science can be cast as state-space search, where theobjective is to find a path from an initial state to a goal state in adirected graph called a ""state space"". State-space search is challenging dueto the state explosion problem a.k.a. ""curse of dimensionality"": interestingstate spaces are often astronomically large, defying brute-force exploration.State-space search has been a core research problem in Artificial Intelligencesince its early days and is alive as ever. Every year, a substantial fractionof research published at the ICAPS and SoCS conferences is concerned withstate-space search, and the topic is very active at general AI conferencessuch as IJCAI and AAAI.Algorithms in the A* family, dating back to 1968, are still the go-to approachfor state-space search. A* is a graph search algorithm whose only""intelligence"" stems from a so-called ""heuristic function"", which estimatesthe distance from a state to the nearest goal state. The efficiency of A*depends on the accuracy of this estimate, and decades of research have pushedthe envelope in devising increasingly accurate estimates.In this project, we question the ""A* + distance estimator"" paradigm andexplore three new directions that go beyond the classical approach:1. We propose a new paradigm of declarative heuristics, where heuristic   information is not represented as distance estimates, but as properties of   solutions amenable to introspection and general reasoning.2. We suggest moving the burden of creativity away from the human expert by   casting heuristic design as a meta-optimization problem that can be solved   automatically.3. We propose abandoning the idea of exploring sequential paths in state   spaces, instead transforming state-space search into combinatorial   optimization problems with no explicit sequencing aspect.

Horizon 2020,RADDICS,Reliable Data-Driven Decision Making in Cyber-Physical Systems,"This ERC project pushes the boundary of reliable data-driven decision making in cyber-physical systems (CPS), by bridging reinforcement learning (RL), nonparametric estimation and robust optimization. RL is a powerful abstraction of decision making under uncertainty and has witnessed dramatic recent breakthroughs. Most of these successes have been in games such as Go - well specified, closed environments that - given enough computing power - can be extensively simulated and explored. In real-world CPS, however, accurate simulations are rarely available, and exploration in these applications is a highly dangerous proposition. We strive to rethink Reinforcement Learning from the perspective of reliability and robustness required by real-world applications. We build on our recent breakthrough result on safe Bayesian optimization (SAFE-OPT): The approach allows - for the first time - to identify provably near-optimal policies in episodic RL tasks, while guaranteeing under some regularity assumptions that with high probability no unsafe states are visited - even if the set of safe parameter values is a priori unknown. While extremely promising, this result has several fundamental limitations, which we seek to overcome in this ERC project. To this end we will (1) go beyond low-dimensional Gaussian process models and towards much richer deep Bayesian models; (2) go beyond episodic tasks, by explicitly reasoning about the dynamics and employing ideas from robust control theory and (3) tackle bootstrapping of safe initial policies by bridging simulations and real-world experiments via multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization, and by pursuing safe active imitation learning. Our research is motivated by three real-world CPS applications, which we pursue in interdisciplinary collaboration: Safe exploration of and with robotic platforms; tuning the energy efficiency of photovoltaic powerplants and safely optimizing the performance of a Free Electron Laser.",Rainer Andreas Krause,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,815943,ERC-2018-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE6 - Computer Science & Informatics,2018,43466,45473,1996500,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/815943,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,UTOPEST,Unified Theory of Efficient Optimization and Estimation,"The goal of this project is to make progress toward a unified theory of efficientoptimization and estimation. In many computing applications, especially machine learning,optimization and estimation problems play an increasingly important role. For that reason, a largeresearch effort is devoted to developing and understanding the limitations of efficient algorithmsfor these problems. For many of these problems, achieving the best known provable guaranteesrequired the use of algorithms that are tailored to problem specifics. In recent years, the PI’sresearch with collaborators has shown that for many optimization problems, the conceptuallysimple sum-of-squares meta-algorithm, despite not being tailored to problem specifics, can matchand often significantly outperform previous efficient algorithms in terms of provable guarantees.This project aims to better understand the capabilities and limitations of this meta-algorithm,especially for estimation problems, which have only recently begun to be studied in this light.In this way, the project will establish new algorithmic guarantees for basic optimization andestimation problems even in the face of non-convexity and adversarial outliers. In the same way,the project will shed light on the limitations of efficient algorithms for basic average-case problemslike planted clique and stochastic block models.The project also aims to transfer the obtained theoretical insights into practical algorithmsbuilding on recent works by the PI and collaborators. Toward this goal the project will developnew algorithms with close to linear running times that match the guarantees of the best knownpolynomial-time algorithms. In order to assess their practicality, the project will perform systematicempirical evaluations of these algorithms.",David Steurer,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,815464,ERC-2018-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE6 - Computer Science & Informatics,2018,43525,45535,1993320,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/815464,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,SUBLINEAR,Sublinear Algorithms for Modern Data Analysis,"Designing efficient algorithms for fundamental computational tasks as well as understanding the limits of tractability has been the goal of computer science since its inception. Polynomial runtime has been the de facto notion of efficiency since the introduction of the notion of NP-completeness. As the sizes of modern datasets grow, however, many classical polynomial time (and sometimes even linear time) solutions become prohibitively expensive. This calls for sublinear algorithms, i.e. algorithms whose resource requirements are substantially smaller than the size of the input that they operate on.  We propose to design a toolbox of powerful algorithmic techniques with sublinear resource requirements that will form the theoretical foundation of large data analysis, as well as develop a nuanced runtime, space and communication complexity theory to show optimality of our algorithms. Specifically, we propose to:1. design an algorithmic toolkit for sublinear graph processing that will form the basis of large scale graph analytics;2. design a new generation of  sublinear algorithms for signal processing that will become the method of choice for a wide range of applications;3. develop a far-reaching set of techniques for lower bounding runtime, space and communication complexity of sublinear algorithms.The  problems that we propose to solve are among the most fundamental algorithmic questions on the forefront of the rapidly developing algorithmic theory of large data analysis, which has been the focus of an extensive body of work in the research community.

Horizon 2020,PRECRIME,Self-assessment Oracles for Anticipatory Testing,"One of the long-lasting dreams in science fiction is the ability to arrest criminals before they even commit crimes. Software testing researchers have a similar dream: when the context for a bug manifestation occurs in the field, the goal is to discover and fix the bug before it causes any in-field failure. In fact, current practice of pre-release testing is severely limited when dealing with autonomous AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems (such as self-driving cars, robots, automated traders, virtual doctors and customer service chatbots), running in complex, rapidly changing environments, which cause their run-time adaptation, learning and knowledge acquisition, because pre-release testing cannot exhaustively explore all different contexts and states in which the software will be running.The PRECRIME project introduces a new, disruptive view on testing, called anticipatory testing and aimed at fixing bugs before they even manifest themselves in the field. Anticipatory testing is activated at run-time by a new type of oracles, called self-assessment oracles, which observe and report unexpected execution contexts. A self-assessment oracle is an estimator of the system’s confidence in being able to handle a new execution context correctly. The goal of anticipatory testing is to anticipate any failure that might occur in the field due to unexpected execution contexts. Whenever an execution context monitored at runtime by self-assessment oracles is estimated as a low confidence context for the system, anticipatory testing exercises the software automatically and extensively in similar contexts. Timely activation of anticipatory testing by runtime observations results in early, anticipatory fault detection. Combined with automated patch synthesis, anticipatory testing leads to the release of a patch for the fault before any software failure occurs in the field.",Paolo Tonella,University of Lugano,Switzerland,-,787703,ERC-2017-ADG,Advanced Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE6 - Computer Science & Informatics,2017,43466,45473,2313250,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/787703,Università della Svizzera italiana
Horizon 2020,FunLearn,Functional learning: From theory to application in bioimaging,"This research program is motivated by the remarkable ability of deep neural networks to improve the quality of biomedical image reconstruction. While the results reported so far are extremely encouraging, serious reservations have been voiced pertaining to the stability of these tools and the extent to which we can trust their output. The main concern is that it is very difficult to control the Lipschitz constant of the current neural architectures. This means that a small perturbation of the input can result in a huge deviation of the output, which can have devastating effects in the context of image reconstruction.   We believe that the remedy lies in the use of much shallower networks, which are easier to control. However, a reduction in the number of layers will degrade the performance, unless we augment the sophistication of the primary modules; in particular, the nonlinear ones.  By drawing on our career-long experience with splines, we therefore propose to rely on the powerful tools of functional optimization to improve learning architectures. This will allow us to develop two novel approaches to learning: sparse simplicial splines, and hierarchical spline networks—an extension of the popular deep ReLU neural networks  In parallel, we shall develop specific neural networks to solve two outstanding problems in biomedical imaging: - A “best-of-both-worlds” approach to biomedical image reconstruction, involving the stable integration of state-of-the-art physics-based solvers with the new tools of machine learning; - The 3D reconstruction of the entire manifold of configurations of a biomolecule from a large collection of very low-dose cryo-electron tomograms.

Horizon 2020,LeMo,Learning Mobility for Real Legged Robots,"Research and applications in legged robotics has made significant progress over the last decade, driven by more advanced actuation systems, better on-board computation, and significantly improved sensors for perceiving the environment. State-of-the-art model-based planning and control algorithms can plan for contact points and body motions to move legged systems over complex environments. However, these methods have shown clear performance limits when it comes to behaviours and situations that are more complex, and it is unclear if and how these limits can be overcome with classical control methods. On the other hand, recent advances in reinforcement learning has put forward unprecedented capabilities to learn control policies for complex behaviours. 
 
With our preliminary findings, we were the first group to present methods that allow directly transferring learned behaviours from simulation to reality to create advanced motion skills for complex legged robots. This breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize the field of legged locomotion control. In this ERC project, we want to research this highly promising area and investigate the use of machine learning tools to make legged robots autonomously move in realistic outdoor scenarios. In three parallel research streams, we will learn how to accurately model the system dynamics from experience, how to abstractify, generate and coordinate different complex behaviours that involve multi-contact situations, and how to combine these with perception to enable autonomous navigation in complex environments. The proposed methods have the potential to overcome the limitations of commonly used optimization-based methods such as limited model accuracy, local minima, conservative performance, computational load and execution time, and it will help us to better understand the fundamentals of locomotion in robots and biology.",Marco Hutter,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,852044,ERC-2019-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE7 - Systems & Communication Engineering,2019,43831,45657,1496370,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/852044,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,NeurO-GI,In vivo gut-brain optogenetic endomicroscopy  for digestive disorders management,"Proper functioning of the digestive system depends largely on the enteric nervous system (the gut’s brain), which on one side is linked to the gut’s microbiota and on the other side is linked to environmental factors, like stress, via gut-brain axis. Communication along this axis is not very well understood, even though it is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of functional digestive disorders, which are the most common problems in the digestive system imposing a significant burden on public health. One of the limiting factors is the lack of tools enabling investigation of gut’s neuronal network in vivo.
	The goal of this proposal is to provide an insight into the functioning of microbiota-gut-brain axis in vivo. We will develop a novel optogenetic endomicroscope based on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) capable of mapping the morphology and the functionality of the enteric nervous system and microbiota sampling. We hypothesize that such tool, in addition to direct analysis of the gut status in various digestive conditions, can also be indirectly used to stimulate the brain response via gut-brain axis. To test our hypothesis, we will co-register performance of the proposed method with functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate in animal models 1) the response of the brain to activation of serotonin neurons in the gut and 2) the response of the gut to optogenetically induced depression at the brain level. 
	Any tool improving understanding of interactions between microbiota, gut and brain would be of paramount importance for improving management of many patients with digestive disorders. Moreover, such information has potential to introduce novel diagnosis and treatment paradigm in obesity, and other diseases like Parkinson disease or Alzheimer disease. With the ultimate goal of transferring our finding into humans, we will be focused on finding OCT-specific designs and biomarkers for diagnosing diseases linked to dysfunction of this axis.

Horizon 2020,SONOBOTS,Acousto-Magnetic Micro/Nanorobots for Biomedical Applications,"Micro/nanorobots can transform many aspects of medicine by enabling tasks, such as delivering drugs or genes precisely to targeted areas, transducing force on individual cells or tissues, performing biopsies, and facilitating non-invasive surgeries. Numerous propulsion mechanisms have been developed, but their low propulsion speed, lack of biocompatibility, and poor navigation capabilities have limited their use. The objective of this proposal is to develop wireless micro/nanorobots using acoustic and magnetic actuation modalities that will be used to navigate in microfluidics and zebrafish disease models to help better understand and treat diseases. The combination of ultrasound and magnetic fields is capable of overcoming the limitations encountered using a single actuation technique, and both are used extensively in clinical diagnostics and therapeutics. This proposal is divided into three research areas. 1) To date, no systematic studies have been conducted utilizing micro/nanorobotics on living animals. The research will address many of the fundamental challenges of using micro/nanorobots in living animals, followed by testing in microfluidics, 3D arbitrarily-shaped fluidic devices, and the vasculature of zebrafish embryos. Propulsion will be studied in the direction of and against blood flow, a 3D propulsion will be developed, and a swarm of nanorobots will be studied. 2) A platform will be developed that involves the trapping and manipulation of nanorobots in an animal model, such as zebrafish embryos. 3) We will develop an active drug delivery platform combined with other methods to study numerous disease models using the models based on live zebrafish embryos.

Horizon 2020,SWING,"Signals, Waves, and Learning: A Data-Driven Paradigm for Wave-Based Inverse Problems","Scattering of waves governs fundamental questions in science, from imaging molecules to fine-tuning concert hall acoustics. Efficient scattering computations rely on sparse representations of wavefields. Spurred by the empirical successes of deep learning, the emphasis has recently shifted to data-driven modeling. However, unlike signal-theoretic implementations that come with sharp approximation guarantees, it remains unclear whether the popular deep learning structures can represent important scattering operators. 

In SWING, we address this question by leveraging advances in signal processing and machine learning. We propose theory and algorithms for the upcoming, learning-based wave of breakthroughs in forward and inverse scattering. SWING is built on three research thrusts: 
1. To design efficient computational structures with approximation guarantees for learning scattering operators. We will focus on minimal structures for Fourier integral operators which model key problems.
2. To treat learning for inverse scattering as a sampling problem and derive practical sample complexity results. We will explore connections between learning theory and stability of inverse problems, and examine the regularization roles of data, physics and nonlinearity. 
3. To apply our techniques to two classes of inverse problems: (i) emerging modalities in molecular imaging, giving rise to problems in geometry and unlabeled sampling; and (ii) seismic tomography of Earth and Mars, with data-driven discretizations of scattering operators playing a central role.
 
With the growth of wave-based sensing, there is an urgency to quantify the limits of the data-driven paradigm in scattering problems. The power of data in fitting models is indisputable: it is certainly the next frontier. We believe, however, that the best designs combine data-based models with an understanding of the underlying physics.

Horizon 2020,AGILEFLIGHT,Low-latency Perception and Action for Agile Vision-based Flight,"Drones are disrupting industries, such as agriculture, package delivery, inspection, and search and rescue. However, they are still either controlled by a human pilot or heavily rely on GPS for navigating autonomously. The alternative to GPS are onboard sensors, such as cameras: from the raw data, a local 3D map of the environment is built, which is then used to plan a safe trajectory to the goal. While the underlying algorithms are well understood, we are still far from having autonomous drones that can navigate through complex environments as good as human pilots. State-of-the-art perception and control algorithms are mature but not robust: coping with unreliable state estimation, low-latency perception, real-time planning in dynamic environments, and tight coupling of perception and action under severe resource constraints are all still unsolved research problems. Another issue is that, because battery energy density is increasing at a very slow rate, drones need to navigate faster in order to accomplish more within their limited flight time. To obtain more agile robots, we need faster sensors and low-latency processing.

The goal of this project is to develop novel scientific methods that would allow me to demonstrate autonomous, vision-based, agile quadrotor navigation in unknown, GPS-denied, and cluttered environments with possibly moving obstacles, which can be as effective in terms of maneuverability and agility as those of professional drone pilots. The outcome would not only be beneficial for disaster response scenarios, but also for other scenarios, such as aerial delivery or inspection. To achieve this ambitious goal, I will first develop robust, low-latency, multimodal perception algorithms that combine the advantages of standard cameras with event cameras. Then, I will develop novel methods that unify perception and state estimation together with planning and control to enable agile maneuvers through cluttered, unknown, and dynamic environments.",Davide Scaramuzza,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,864042,ERC-2019-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE7 - Systems & Communication Engineering,2019,44075,45900,2000000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/864042,University of Zurich
Horizon 2020,EMPOWER,Medium Voltage Direct Current Electronic Transformer,"More than a century ago, the invention of alternating current (AC) transformer has made AC the preferred choice over the direct current (DC) technologies. Line AC transformers are bulky but simple and reliable devices, made out of copper and iron, providing voltage adaptation and galvanic isolation in AC power systems. Currently, DC technology is increasing its presence in AC power systems, enabled by progress in semiconductor devices and power electronics based energy conversion. DC power distribution networks can effectively support energy transformation and high penetration of distributed energy resources and energy storage integration (both increasingly being DC by nature) in future energy systems. Despite this shift towards the DC power distribution networks, DC Transformer, offering AC transformer like features (and beyond) does not exist, either conceptually or practically.To enable the next (r)evolution in power systems, the EMPOWER project will develop the DC Transformer, a novel, flexible, highly efficient, compact, and reliable conversion principle for seamless energy routing in high-power DC distribution networks. Through a holistic approach, novel concepts, integration and optimization, we will demonstrate new design paradigms for galvanically-isolated power conversion. Our approach relies on resonant conversion utilizing high-voltage semiconductor devices in combination with high-frequency magnetic materials. We propose a new approach for the DC Transformer, avoiding active power flow control and instead utilizing control effort for the safety and protection. The DC Transformer will unify functions of a power converter and a protection device into a single power electronics system, improving drastically the conversion efficiency, reliability and power density in future DC power distribution networks.

Horizon 2020,FeelAgain,Restoring natural feelings from missing or damaged peripheral nervous system by model-driven neuroprosthesis,"Due to sensory loss diabetic patients are prone to falls and to foot ulcers, which consequently increase the risk of amputations. Because of the lack of sensory feedback amputees experience falls, perceive the prosthesis as a foreign body and therefore do not rely on it during walking. This causes counterbalancing movements that increase fatigue. Both types of patients suffer neuropathic pain, associable to aberrant sensory inputs. Neural pathways between the periphery and the brain are still functional above the damage or the amputation. Targeting these structures with peripheral neural interfaces could allow the restoration of natural sensory functionalities. The aim of project is to develop the first neuroprosthesis restoring natural foot sensations, through sciatic nerve stimulation, to patients with diabetic neuropathy or leg amputation. To that aim we will develop a detailed computational model of the sensory loop of the sciatic nerve. It will merge the electrical stimulation effects on sensory fibers and transduction of mechanical deformations of the skin into action potentials. Modelling results will be validated through animal experiments involving the stimulation of sciatic nerve, and simultaneous recordings from the dorsal root ganglion. Applying this modeling framework we will optimize the geometry of a peripheral neural interface, its surgical placement and define stimulation protocols that mimic natural sensory feedback responses. Effective device for feedback restoration will be constructed, able to translate the signals recorded by sensorized sole placed under the prosthetic or diabetic foot into the natural foot sensations perceived by subject. The interventional tools for embodiment boosting and pain relief will be developed.

Horizon 2020,PISSARRO,Photonic integrated devices for second order nonlinear optical processes,"Second order nonlinear processes, such as second-harmonic or difference-frequency generation, are key for frequency metrology and quantum optics applications. The successful integration of such functionalities, consequential of material 2nd order nonlinear susceptibility χ(2),  is essential to obtain compact and low power devices. Unfortunately embedding 2nd order nonlinear effects on chip poses a fundamental challenge captured by the following dogma: materials with the best photonic integration capabilities exhibit negligible χ(2). Recent research by the PI proves this dogma flawed and shows that 2nd order nonlinearities can be unlocked in silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides by all-optical means, a result that is a significant departure from other existing approaches. PISSARRO will develop waveguides for χ(2) based effects and confront the limitations imposed by fabrication, resonant structures, or phase-matching constraints, thus seeking optimal trade-offs. By leveraging the linear properties and fabrication flexibility of SiN waveguides, the synergy between optically induced electric field from multi-photon absorption, large material 3rd order nonlinearity  and waveguide engineering will be exploited, to overcome the initial low efficiency. The objectives are far beyond the state-of-the-art by providing all-optical control, flexibility and extended operation bandwidth. The project will build on the in-depth optical characterization of the microscopic nature of optically-induced 2nd order nonlinearity in SiN to take integrated 2nd order nonlinear devices to new frontiers. PISSARRO promises substantial impact in the domains of communication, metrology and quantum optics by providing novel CMOS-compatible photonic devices.

Horizon 2020,OCAL,Optimal Control at Large,"Despite wide ranging progress on both the theory and applications of optimal control for more than half a century, considerable challenges remain when it comes to applying the resulting methods to large scale systems. The difficulties become even greater when one moves outside the classical realm of model based optimal control to address problems where models are replaced by data, or macroscopic behaviours emerge out of microscopic interactions of large populations of agents. To address these challenges, we propose here to develop a framework for approximating optimal control problems using randomised optimisation. The starting point will be formulations of optimal control problems as infinite dimensional linear programs. Our recent work suggests that randomised methods on the one hand can serve as a basis for algorithms to approximate such infinite programs and on the other enjoy close connections to statistical learning theory, providing a direct link to data driven approaches. Turning these intuitions into an approximation framework for optimal control that rests on solid theoretical foundations and provides explicit accuracy guarantees will be the methodological contribution of the proposed research. The resulting methods can find a range of applications in engineering and beyond; here we will investigate two such applications. One is motivated by our work on energy management in buildings and districts. The challenge here is the dimensionality of the system, especially if one would like to include weather and other forecast information and the corresponding uncertainty. The second application will be to so-called population systems, that involve the interaction of many agents with local decision-making capabilities coupled through the use of common resources.

This proposal extends our recent demonstration of a dual-comb MIXSEL (ModelockedIntegrated eXternal-cavity Surface Emitting Lasers) in the near-infrared, validated by measuring weak waterabsorption at 968 nm. Many more relevant gas absorption lines, however, are in the mid-infrared, wheresensitivities of parts-per-billion can be achieved.Dual-comb mid-IR spectroscopy applications are currently limited by the cost, complexity, and size ofconventional optical comb systems, based on two modelocked lasers with four active stabilization loops. Thesingle-source dual-comb MIXSEL, however, substantially reduces the complexity of existing systems to asingle compact free-running laser. In comparison to other competing new approaches such as quantum cascadelasers or micro resonator combs, the MIXSEL provides substantially more power per comb line with lowlinewidth and noise, and is ideally suited for a 1 to 5 GHz comb spacing, which is optimal for many molecularspectroscopy applications, allowing for fast, accurate, and sensitive absorption measurements.This proposal leverages our know-how in MIXSEL design combined with III-V semiconductor epitaxy todemonstrate this new class of lasers in the mid-IR, enabling simpler, lower-cost systems with sufficient speedand sensitivity for many relevant and commercially interesting applications in the 2 to 5 μm spectral region,such as CO2 , CH4, or NOx trace gas detection.

TRANS will develop novel high dielectric permittivity elastomers and piezoelectric elastomers with an unprecedented collection of properties and use them as active components in devices for emerging technologies. The devices are not only of high technological and scientific importance, but also exhibit substantial economic and societal impact.

However, the theoretical upper limit of the device external quantum efficiency (EQE) is only ~20%, considerably lower than those in OLEDs and InGaN LEDs. The fundamental bottleneck is that it is not yet possible to control the emission directionality perpendicular to the substrate plane in the CQD superlattices, without compromising the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). As a result, a lot of photons are wasted due to the total internal reflection (TIR) at the air/glass interface, as well as exciton quenching during interparticle energy transfer.
In order to overcome the efficiency limitation, my research group pioneers synthesis, physics, and LED device of layer-controlled colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) of organic-inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites (OIHPs), the two-dimensional nanocrystals of OIHP in colloidal solution. Our results have suggested that the materials system might be the ultimate solution for the quantum-dot based LEDs. We found that the CQWs possess: (i) the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics, boosting the film PLQY up to 97%, and (ii) the emission directionality (ED) perpendicular to the substrate plane in their self-assembled superlattices. Based on the new photophysical properties that have never been foundin any other CQD systems, in this proposal, we aim to optimally utilize the characteristics of the AIE and ED, in order to realize high-efficiency and long-lifetime LED technology that can fulfill 100% Rec. 2020 color gamut.",Chih-Jen Shih,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,849229,ERC-2019-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE8 - Products & Processes Engineering,2019,43831,45657,1498515,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/849229,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,DESCALE,De-railing scaling: From fundamentals of crystallization fouling on nano-materials to rational design of scale-phobic surfaces,"Crystallization fouling, a process where scale forms on surfaces, is pervasive in nature and technology, negatively impacting the energy conversion and water treatment industries. Despite significant efforts, rationally designed materials that are intrinsically resistant to crystallization fouling without the use of active methods like antiscalant additives (which can persist long after their disposal and the toxicological impact of which in effluent is questioned) remain elusive. This is because antiscalant surfaces are constructed today without sufficient reliance on an intricate but necessary science-base, of how interweaved interfacial thermofluidics, nucleation thermodynamics, and surface nanoengineering control the onset of nucleation and adhesion of frequently encountered scaling salts like calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate. Such scaling salts are common components of fouling deposits in industrial heat exchangers and membranes, which significantly inhibit heat transfer and flow performance. Therefore, guided by interfacial thermofluidic and thermodynamics theories, and employing advanced experimental methods in the areas of surface nanoengineering and diagnostics, this project will develop an integrated knowledge-base for how engineered surfaces can beneficially interact with interfacial transport phenomena in order to significantly advance antiscalant surfaces. We aim to pinpoint mechanisms for inhibiting scale nucleation and reducing adhesion in order to design and engineer antiscalant materials based on the collaborative action of their composition and topography. The effects of surface texture curvature, surface composition, and substrate compliance on scale nucleation and adhesion have intertwined and sometimes competing impacts, which we aim at elucidating to realize high performance scale-phobic surfaces. Connected to this are cutting edge materials fabrication techniques and considerations to the development of surfaces for future applications.",Thomas Schutzius,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,853257,ERC-2019-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE8 - Products & Processes Engineering,2019,43862,45991,1963625,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/853257,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,NanoBiOptics,A Synthetic Biology Approach to Developing Optical NanoAnalytics,"Bioengineering is the synthetic biologist’s approach to engineering materials. It allows researchers to overcome billions of years of evolution to create unnatural biomolecules equipped with interactions unfounded in nature. Biomolecules offer unparalleled molecular recognition that can be tuned by engineers to create highly specific sensors. Unfortunately, biology has its limits; many biological optical sensors rely on fluorophores with limited lifetimes and visible emissions that overlap with tissue absorption. Unlike these fluorophores, single-walled carbon nanotubes benefit from fluorescence that is indefinitely photostable, demonstrating sensitivities that can detect analytes down to the single molecule. Their near-infrared wavelengths are also transparent to tissue absorption, allowing for continuous in vivo sensing. Unfortunately, these nanomaterials lack the molecular recognition biology has to offer.

In a sense, the advantages and disadvantages posed by the fields of bio- and nano-materials engineering are highly complementary. This proposal envisions a new generation of NanoBiOptic devices – devices that exploit the synergy of nano-bio hybrids – for sensing applications. We aim to bring to the nanosensor community what directed evolution has brought to chemistry; a guided approach to tuning interactions. We apply bioengineering techniques, such as artificial nucleic acid design as well as directed evolution, to circumvent current limitations in engineering nanosensors. In demonstrating these techniques, we realize previously intractable optical platforms for bioanalyte detection, as well as a single-molecule basis for imaging DNA-protein interactions, such as those found in CRISPR. Synthetic biology thus has the potential to complement the physical sciences in the engineering of new synthetic optical platforms, enabling a “revolution through evolution” of synthetic nanomaterials.",Ardemis Boghossian,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,853005,ERC-2019-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE8 - Products & Processes Engineering,2019,44105,45930,1499495,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/853005,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,NanoMMs,Solution-Based Engineering of Nanodimensional Phase-Change Materials and Memory Devices,"Phase-change memory (PCM) is a recently-commercialized next-generation memory storage technology that provides a sustainable solution to exponentially-growing memory storage demands of modern society. It is based on resistively switched structural changes of memory cell upon local crystallization and melting phase transitions, resulting in amorphous or crystalline atomic structures with distinctly different “0” and “1” resistance states. PCM is faster and more durable than state-of-the-art non-volatile memory devices like silicon-based solid-state drives (SSD), and it can furthermore be scaled in all three dimensions. However, there are open challenges for PCM technology, such as large power consumption and high price of PCM devices, which stem from large dimensions of memory cells, complex fabrication process, and from use of material-inefficient sputtering and etching fabrication steps for the expensive PCM layer.
This proposal addresses the open challenges and enables further development of PCM technology by applying solution-based engineering. Our goals are (i) to develop robust synthetic approaches for PCM materials, such as ternary tellurides and antimony-rich compositions, in the form of colloidal nanoparticles and molecular ink precursors; (ii) to thoroughly study how PCM properties change at the nanoscale as a function of size, thickness, and composition; and (iii) to employ these phase-change nanomaterials in solution-processed PCM arrays to build new, ultrasmall PCM configurations as well as multilayer PCM cells and to reduce their price and power consumption.",Maksym Yarema,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,852751,ERC-2019-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE8 - Products & Processes Engineering,2019,43831,45657,1604600,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/852751,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,TAMING CORROSION,Towards mastering the long-standing challenge of ageing infrastructures in corrosive environments,"TAMING CORROSION proposes a radically new approach to the long-standing challenge of mitigating corrosion of infrastructures – such as bridges, pipelines, etc. The socio-economic burden of replacing and repairing infrastructures due to corrosion is staggering. In the EU alone, estimates are in the range of 250 billion € annually, with an expected steep increase over the coming decades. This urgently calls for new, cost-effective corrosion mitigation strategies to prolong the useful life of ageing civil infrastructures. Electrochemical corrosion protection (ECP) methods have a large potential to play a key role in addressing this challenge. However, to match these expectations, game-changing advances are needed in both science and engineering. Limited routine use and poor engineering practice of ECP can be traced to insufficient theoretical grounds and a lack of fundamental quantification of key processes. The aim of this proposal is to develop the scientific basis to deliver the first scientifically anchored engineering model and to unlock the potential of ECP as an innovative solution to the grand challenge of rapidly deteriorating infrastructures. The focus areas include: 1) for the first time integrating all relevant physical, chemical, and electrochemical processes into a quantitative model framework for the systematic study of fundamental processes and evaluation of solution strategies. An important novelty lies in combining reactive transport modeling in porous media with rigorous corrosion science. 2) Elucidating the poorly understood role of microbiology in corrosion; and 3) Devising new experiments that link corrosion science and electrochemistry with environmental science methods. Only by delivering ground-breaking scientific contributions will it be possible to abandon empiricism in the field and pave the way towards a new, scientifically sound generation of ECP technology to ensure safety, cost-efficiency, and sustainability of our infrastructures.",Ueli Angst,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,848794,ERC-2019-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE8 - Products & Processes Engineering,2019,43831,45657,1497815,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/848794,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,PERTURB,Using periodic orbits to quantitatively describe and control 3D fluid turbulence.,"Fluid turbulence is of key importance in engineering: it controls the drag on aircraft, is a major contributor to unwanted energy dissipation in pipelines, yet mixing of chemicals relies on it. Despite its importance, our understanding of turbulence is incomplete. Controlling turbulent flows, which would lead to significant efficiencies for industrial applications, remains a challenge. 

The recent identification of unstable non-chaotic solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations suggests a promising framework to study the phenomenon. Here turbulence is viewed as a chaotic walk through a forest of exact solutions in the infinite-dimensional state space of the flow equations. While this dynamical systems approach helps rationalizing features of the transition to turbulence, it has so far failed to deliver on the promise it carried since the identification of deterministic chaos in the mid 20th century: To provide a predictive description of turbulence in terms of exact solutions and to act as a rational basis for controlling flows. 

The major road block to fulfilling the promise is that we are missing tools to identify enough dynamically relevant exact solutions. These are time-periodic non-chaotic solutions that allow us to express statistical properties of turbulence as a weighted average over periodic orbits. Owing to the exponential error amplification in a chaotic system, periodic obits for 3D flows have been almost inaccessible. Instead, research has focused on isolated steady solutions that resemble features of the flow but are dynamically less informative. 

We will remove the road block and construct extensive libraries of periodic orbits for two canonical 3D flows, turbulent convection and channel flow. By combining variational methods with machine learning tools we will automatically compute periodic orbits of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. Using periodic orbit theory, we will describe and control flow properties including heat transport and turbulent drag.",Tobias Manuel Schneider,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,865677,ERC-2019-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE8 - Products & Processes Engineering,2019,44197,46022,1999830,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/865677,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,NaCRe,Nature-inspired Circular Recycling for Polymers,"In 2070, 10^12 Kg of plastics (polymers) could be produced yearly in a world inhabited by 11 billion people. Hence, we have ~50 years to address this sustainability challenge. The sourcing and disposing of such quantities without a significant environmental impact will not be possible, even if everything is bio-sourced and bio-degraded. Yet, on earth, there are >10^12 Kg of proteins (one of Nature’s polymers). They are sustainable because they are recycled in a circular way. If we exemplify their metabolism, proteins are decomposed by living organisms into their monomeric constituents (the amino acids, AAs); the cell machinery uses such AAs to synthesize new proteins that have little in common with the original ones. This is only possible because a protein is a specific sequence of AAs bound together by cleavable peptide bonds, i.e. proteins are sequence-defined polymers, SDPs. Nature reuses and does not degrade AAs, thus assuring protein sustainability. This project aims at showing that such a circular approach to recycle SDPs is possible for technologically-relevant polymers using engineering-sound laboratory processes. One aim is to show that b-Lactoglobulin, a milk protein used as a component for water filtration membranes, can be digested into its AAs, that, in turn, can be used to form Fibroin, a silk protein used in resistive switching memory devices. Fibroin will be converted into Keratin, a wool protein, that will be converted back into b-Lactoglobulin. Another aim is to perform the whole process within an automated and scalable robotic platform. The final aim is to expand this concept from natural proteins to DNA and non-natural SDPs. There would be a paradigm shift in plastic recycling, if a random mixture of any polymers could be used to produce any other polymer on earth, without taxing the planet with degradation products. Scope of this project is to show that such a vision in the circular use of polymers is scientifically and technologically possible.",Francesco Stellacci,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,884114,ERC-2019-ADG,Advanced Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE8 - Products & Processes Engineering,2019,44197,46022,3375000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/884114,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,UltimateMembranes,Energy-efficient membranes for carbon capture by crystal engineering of two-dimensional nanoporous materials,"The EU integrated strategic energy technology plan, SET-plan, in its 2016 progress report, has called for urgent measures on the carbon capture, however, the high energy-penalty and environmental issues related to the conventional capture process (amine-based scrubbing) has been a major bottleneck. High-performance membranes can reduce the energy penalty for the capture, are environment-friendly (no chemical is used, no waste is generated), can intensify chemical processes, and can be employed for the capture in a decentralized fashion. However, a technological breakthrough is needed to realize such chemically and thermally stable, high-performance membranes. This project seeks to develop the ultimate high-performance membranes for H2/CO2 (pre-combustion capture), CO2/N2 (post-combustion capture), and CO2/CH4 separations (natural gas sweetening). Based on calculations, these membranes will yield a gigantic gas permeance (1 and 0.1 million GPU for the H2 and the CO2 selective membranes, respectively), 1000 and 10-fold higher than that of the state-of-the-art polymeric and nanoporous membranes, respectively, reducing capital expenditure per unit performance and the needed membrane area. For this, we introduce three novel concepts, combining the top-down and the bottom-up crystal engineering approaches to develop size-selective, chemically and thermally stable, nanoporous two-dimensional membranes. First, exfoliated nanoporous 2d nanosheets will be stitched in-plane to synthesize the truly-2d membranes. Second, metal-organic frameworks will be confined across a nanoporous 2d matrix to prepare a composite 2d membrane. Third, atom-thick graphene films with tunable, uniform and size-selective nanopores will be crystallized using a novel thermodynamic equilibrium between the lattice growth and etching. Overall, the innovative concepts developed here will open up several frontiers on the synthesis of high-performance membranes for a wide-range of separation processes.

Horizon 2020,AMADEUS,Advancing CO2 Capture Materials by Atomic Scale Design: the Quest for Understanding,"Carbon dioxide capture and storage is a technology to mitigate climate change by removing CO2 from flue gas streams or the atmosphere and storing it in geological formations. While CO2 removal from natural gas by amine scrubbing is implemented on the large scale, the cost of such process is currently prohibitively expensive. Inexpensive alkali earth metal oxides (MgO and CaO) feature high theoretical CO2 uptakes, but suffer from poor cyclic stability and slow kinetics. Yet, the key objective of recent research on alkali earth metal oxide based CO2 sorbents has been the processing of inexpensive, naturally occurring CO2 sorbents, notably limestone and dolomite, to stabilize their modest CO2 uptake and to establish re-activation methods through engineering approaches. While this research demonstrated a landmark Megawatt (MW) scale viability of the process, our fundamental understanding of the underlying CO2 capture, regeneration and deactivation pathways did not improve. The latter knowledge is, however, vital for the rational design of improved, yet practical CaO and MgO sorbents. Hence this proposal is concerned with obtaining an understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control the ability of an alkali metal oxide to capture a large quantity of CO2 with a high rate, to regenerate and to operate with high cyclic stability. Achieving these aims relies on the ability to fabricate model structures and to characterize in great detail their surface chemistry, morphology, chemical composition and changes therein under reactive conditions. This makes the development of operando and in situ characterization tools an essential prerequisite. Advances in these areas shall allow achieving the overall goal of this project, viz. to formulate a roadmap to fabricate improved CO2 sorbents through their precisely engineered structure, composition and morphology.",Christoph Rüdiger Müller,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,819573,ERC-2018-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE8 - Products & Processes Engineering,2018,43617,45443,1994900,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/819573,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,TORCH,ThermoacOustic instabilities contRol in sequential Combustion cHambers,"A new type of combustor architecture for large gas turbines has emerged in recent years: sequential combustion systems operated at constant pressure. This major technology change results from the need for more operationally and fuel flexible gas turbines, for future sustainable energy networks. As for regular gas turbines, the risk of combustor breakdown due to thermoacoustic instabilities is a major challenge. While the harmful consequences of these instabilities in novel sequential combustors can be as dramatic as in conventional systems, the associated physics is considerably complexified, because the two flames not only “talk” together via sound waves, but also via entropy waves. Our aim is to propose, investigate and develop novel active and passive control technologies, tailored for this new generation of combustors, in order to suppress their thermoacoustic instabilities. It brings significant scientific challenges in fluid mechanics, acoustics, combustion, nonlinear dynamics and control theory. We will address the problem of controlling these instabilities on two unexplored fronts: First, we intend to significantly move forward the state-of-the-art in passive control of combustion instabilities, by creating acoustic metamaterials with unprecedented acoustic damping properties, and capable of long term operation in harsh environments. Second, we plan to address scientific challenges, required to successfully achieve active combustion control in sequential combustors, by distributing non-equilibrium plasma discharges to locally and dynamically enhance the autoignition chemistry. To achieve these ambitious goals, a combination of experimental, numerical and theoretical methods will be applied with the aim to ultimately establish the potential and limitations of these novel technologies.

Horizon 2020,PonD,Particles-on-Demand for Multiscale Fluid Dynamics,"Computational fluid dynamics achieved undeniable success in many sectors of flowing matter. However, with the variety of different physical phenomena involved, also the computational methods have specialized and a uniform platform for high-quality simulations has long been in pursuit. With its roots in kinetic theory and statistical mechanics, the lattice Boltzmann method was conceived as an alternative paradigm for fluid dynamics but only partially succeeded in a subclass of incompressible flows. The reasons for that are structural: fixed particles’ velocities in traditional approaches imply rigid constraints on Mach number and temperature in the simulations, and which can only be mitigated at a price of ever increased number of particles’ speeds. A novel formulation of fluid dynamics as a kinetic theory with a small number of tailored, on-demand constructed particles removes any restrictions on flow speed and temperature as compared the lattice Boltzmann methods and their modifications. Particles-on-Demand method is a disruptive change of perspective on computational fluid dynamics through kinetic theory that opens up an unprecedented wide domain of applications, and for the first time delivers a seamless and universal computing of any type of flow, from high Knudsen number rarefied gas to supersonic flow and turbulence. Our approach is inherently physical and rigorous, with kinetic theory translated onto a fully discrete framework in position, momentum, time and space system. Particle-on-Demand shall deliver new solutions to hypersonic flows involving fluid-structure interaction and makes it easy to incorporate mixing and chemical reactions. The strength and universality of PonD method shall be demonstrated with simulations of a wide spectrum of multiscale problems such as atmospheric reentry, geostrophic turbulence, micro-flows and multiphase flow.

Horizon 2020,CATACOAT,Nanostructured catalyst overcoats for renewable chemical production from biomass,"In the CATACOAT project, we will develop layer-by-layer solution-processed catalyst overcoating methods, which will result in catalysts that have both targeted and broad impacts. We will produce highly active, stable and selective catalysts for the upgrading of lignin – the largest natural source of aromatic chemicals – into commodity chemicals, which will have an important targeted impact. The broader impact of our work will lie in the production of catalytic materials with unprecedented control over the active site architecture.There is an urgent need to provide these cheap, stable, selective, and highly active catalysts for renewable molecule production. Thanks to its availability and relatively low cost, lignocellulosic biomass is an attractive source of renewable carbon. However, unlike petroleum, biomass-derived molecules are highly oxygenated, and often produced in dilute-aqueous streams. Heterogeneous catalysts – the workhorses of the petrochemical industry – are sensitive to water and contain many metals that easily sinter and leach in liquid-phase conditions. The production of renewable chemicals from biomass, especially valuable aromatics, often requires expensive platinum group metals and suffers from low selectivity.Catalyst overcoating presents a potential solution to this problem. Recent breakthroughs using catalyst overcoating with atomic layer deposition (ALD) showed that base metal catalysts can be stabilized against sintering and leaching in liquid phase conditions. However, ALD creates dramatic drops in activity due to excessive coverage, and forms an overcoat that cannot be tuned.Our materials will feature the controlled placement of metal sites (including single atoms), several oxide sites, and even molecular imprints with sub-nanometer precision within highly accessible nanocavities. We anticipate that such materials will create unprecedented opportunities for reducing cost and increasing sustainability in the chemical industry and beyond.",Jeremy Scott Luterbacher,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,758653,ERC-2017-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE8 - Products & Processes Engineering,2017,43070,45199,1785195,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/758653,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,COGRA,Decoding the Mechanics of Metals by Coarse-Grained Atomistics,"""First principles"" and ""bottom-up"" have become buzz words across scientific and engineering disciplines when it comes to the discovery, prediction and understanding of material properties and their link to processing and microstructure. Reality, however, teaches us that in the foreseeable future computational resources will be insufficient to apply predictive techniques such as quantum mechanics or atomistics to the technologically most relevant length and time scales - far above nanometers and nanoseconds. This proposal aims for nothing less but the seemingly impossible: the application of atomistic techniques to problems occurring over microns to millimeters and seconds to minutes. Instead of relying on computational power, this will be achieved by a combination of scale-bridging methodologies (involving the PI's nonlocal and meshless quasicontinuum techniques, concepts from particle methods, continuum and statistical mechanics) and computational science strategies in order to produce new theory and an open-source, computational toolset for long-term, large-scale simulations relying solely on atomistic input. Spatial upscaling, temporal upscaling as well as heat and mass transfer will be addressed. Enabled by the new scale-bridging capabilities, two representative, open challenges will be investigated: recrystallization in magnesium during thermo-mechanical processing and corrosion in steel by hydrogen embrittlement. Both are of enormous technological and economic importance but current techniques are insufficient to bridge the gap between the macroscopic mechanical performance, microstructural mechanisms and predictive atomic-scale simulations.

Horizon 2020,HINBOTS,"Highly Integrated Nanoscale Robots for Targeted Delivery to the Central Nervous System
","Over the past two decades researchers have been working to create synthetic small-scale machines ranging from molecular entities or miniaturized structures, to more complex assemblies of micro- and nanomaterials. These machines are able to navigate in complex environments by harvesting fuel from the surrounding media or from external power sources. One of the most sought-after applications for these miniaturized machines is to perform minimally invasive interventions, in which these devices will ultimately reduce risk, cost, and discomfort compared to conventional interventions. This has driven researchers to produce a myriad of small-scale robots loaded with therapeutic cargo. While recent research has demonstrated the potential of these devices in animal models, a number of challenges remain in moving small-scale robots into the operating theatre. Here, we propose highly integrated nanorobots capable of realizing several functions on-demand by capitalizing on recent developments in small-scale robotics, multiferroics, supramolecular chemistry, and gated materials. These nanorobots will integrate a porous inorganic active chassis made of a piezoelectric or a magnetoelectric multiferroic that will host therapeutic agents, with redox or electroresponsive supramolecular gates that will control the release of payloads. We will demonstrate for the first time that redox- and electroresponsive supramolecular machinery grafted onto the surface of piezoelectric or multiferroic platforms can be remotely controlled by means of a piezoelectrochemical potential triggered by acoustic and magnetic fields.

The goal is to alter the soil structure and its mechanical properties for ultimately securing the integrity of structures. The BIOGEOS project puts the focus on bio-mediated soil improvement, which falls within the broader framework of multi-physical processes in geo-mechanics. The goal of the project is to engineer a novel, natural material under controlled processes, for ultimately providing solutions to real problems in the geo-engineering and geo-energy fields by advancing knowledge around complex multi-physical phenomena in porous media. The bio-cemented geo-material, which is produced by carefully integrating the metabolic activity of native soil bacteria, is produced through the bio-mineralization of calcite bonds, which act as natural cementation for endowing the subsurface with real cohesion and increased resistance. A principal characteristic of the project is its multi-scale approach through advanced experimentation to identify the main physical mechanisms involved in the formation of the bio-mineralized bonds and their behaviour under mechanical loading. The development of such a bio-mediated technology will lead to innovative applications in a series of engineering problems such as the restoration of weak foundations, seismic retrofitting, erosion protection, and the enhancement of heat transfer in thermo-active geo-structures. The project foresees to adopt multiple loading conditions for its laboratory characterization and ultimately pass to the large experimental scale.

Horizon 2020,SNICC,Studying Secondary Nucleation for the Intensification of Continuous Crystallization,"Many products in the chemical, food and pharmaceutical industry are produced as powders through a crystallization process. Continuous crystallization has been for decades the process of choice for large-scale production, for instance of sugar, table salt, adipic acid, and has become more recently a key component of the new paradigm, i.e. the continuousmanufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients.All product crystals of continuous crystallization processes are formed through secondary nucleation, which is both ubiquitous and elusive. Research has left several key questions unanswered, such as about where and how secondary nuclei are formed, either from the parent crystal due to  collisions or from the solution layer around it due to fluid shear; orabout the rate at which secondary nuclei are generated, with which properties, and under which conditions; or, also, about the coupling between the parent crystal microscale and the collective behavior of the ensemble of crystals suspended in a specific continuous crystallizer.The project SNICC intends to unveil the microscale mechanisms of secondary nucleation, and to bring its scientific understanding to a level where it can be exploited to model, design, operate, optimize and control continuous crystallization processes at any desired scale. It aims at creating a comprehensive knowledge about secondary nucleation at the microscale, applicable to any type of compound, and at establishing guidelines for the intensification of continuous crystallization, based on the use of newly developed full models of different types of continuous crystallizers. This will have a major impact on both the science of crystallization and the related industrial processes.

Horizon 2020,H1PStars,Measuring Hubble's Constant to 1% with Pulsating Stars,"What's up with Hubble's constant (H0)? Recent H0 measurements have shown that the Universe is expanding faster than cosmology predicts, indicating a possible cosmological crisis. To wit, H0 measured to 1.9% precision in today's Universe using a cosmic distance ladder composed of classical Cepheids and type-Ia supernovae differs by 8.9% (4.2 sigma) from H0 predicted by cosmology based on observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background emitted 13.8 billion years ago. However, it remains unclear whether new physics must be invoked to reconcile cosmology with today's H0, or whether today's H0 is subject to as yet unknown or underestimated systematic errors. An unbiased 1% measurement of H0 is required to understand whether physics is on the brink of a major breakthrough.

So, how solid is our distance ladder? To answer this, my research seeks to a) mitigate biases that can shift the center value of reported H0 measurements, b) quantify relevant systematic uncertainties, and c) reinforce the foundation of the distance ladder through a solid astrophysical understanding of pulsating stars, in particular, classical Cepheids. These steps must be taken now to achieve an unbiased 1% H0 measurement and to ensure the legacy of today's distance ladder for future space-borne facilities and ground-based extremely large telescopes. Imminent data releases of the ESA mission Gaia and precise time series spectroscopy will provide unprecedented opportunity to calibrate the distance ladder and unravel the structure and evolution of Cepheids through their variability.

My extensive expertise in both the astrophysics of classical Cepheids and the calibration of the distance ladder uniquely qualifies me to support precision cosmology via accurate stellar physics, and vice versa, and provides the much-needed fresh perspective to either reconcile the tension in H0, or confidently establish a need to revise cosmology.

Horizon 2020,PLAMO,Planet- and Moon-Factory,"Understanding better planet- and moon-formation is a key to comprehend how planetary systems –
including our own – came to be. To study these processes, we need computer simulations of their birth
nests, the disks around the young stars (circumstellar disks) where planets are born; and disks around
forming planets (circumplanetary disks) where moons assemble. Circumplanetary disks are located within
the circumstellar disks and they were first detected observationally in June 2019, after twenty years of
numerical simulations predicting their existence. Therefore, it is very timely to study their characteristics.
Circumplanetary disks have three main roles. Firstly, the are channelling material to the forming planets,
hence they regulate the formation timescale and the final planetary mass. Secondly, they are the birth-place
for moons to grow. Thirdly, they surround and embed the forming planet, hence affect the observational
appearance of forming planets.
Developing state-of-the-art gas-dust thermo-hydrodynamical simulations, combining them with radiative
transfer, N-body simulations, and for the first time with machine learning, offers a completely new window
to reveal how planet- and moon-formation takes place. The three scientific projects of this proposal are: I.
Understanding the thermo-hydrodynamical effects on planetary growth, on the formation timescale at
different locations of the circumstellar disk, and hence the diversity of the final planetary masses. II.
Observational predictions of forming planets from the simulations – which instrument can be used to
detect them, what information can be gained from these observations, and what are the general
characteristics of circumstellar disks determined with machine learning. III. Studying moon-formation in
the circumplanetary disk, provide predictions of how the exomoon population looks like, and what fraction
of exomoons is detectable with current and near-future instrumentation.",Judit Szulagyi,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,948467,ERC-2020-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE9 - Universe Sciences,2020,44197,46387,1261336,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/948467,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,SPICE DUNE,A SpectroPhotometric Inquiry of Close-in Exoplanets around the Desert to Understand their Nature and Evolution,"Half of known exoplanets orbit close to their star, featuring a desert of hot Neptunes whose origins remain uncertain. These planets may have lost their gas atmosphere, eroding into the dust-rich rocky planets found below the desert. Testing this scenario requires deriving accurate mass losses, but a lack of observational tracers prevented us from validating and refining models of escaping atmospheres. The coupling of atmospheric evolution with orbital migration, which can bring planets close to their star in various ways and delay their erosion, also remains to be explored.
My work on infrared spectroscopy recently opened a new window into atmospheric escape, complementing traditional ultraviolet observations. I further brought to light an interplay between escape and migration by discovering that two warm Neptunes survive on the edge of the desert despite strong mass loss. I showed from one of these planets' orbital architecture that it migrated recently, triggering its erosion. These breakthroughs highlight the way to determine the origin of the desert:
1) Gathering UV/IR spectra (gas) and Vis/IR photometry (dust) for a representative sample of planets around the desert
2) Developing a self-consistent model of escaping atmosphere, validated by observations, which accounts for dust and gas physics. Interpreting data from 1) with this cutting-edge model will yield accurate mass loss for both gaseous and rocky planets
3) Measuring the sample orbital architectures, and combining them with mass losses for the first time to constrain population syntheses coupling long-term orbital and atmospheric evolution.
This ambitious approach, exploiting advanced modeling informed by the most relevant tracers, will unveil the evolutionary tracks of exoplanets and bring insights into their nature. Challenges lie in developing a versatile atmospheric model and acquiring a sufficient sample.

Horizon 2020,ASTRODUST,The Heliosphere and the Dust: Characterization of the  Solar and Interstellar Neighbourhood,"The Sun and the surrounding heliosphere move through a low-density region in the Galaxy, which is filled with partially ionized gas and interstellar dust. While the Voyager 1 and 2 missions are currently exploring the heliosphere boundary regions that are shaped by both the Sun and by the Local Interstellar Medium (LISM), fundamental questions about our galactic neighbourhood remain unanswered: how is the structure and dynamics of the heliosphere, how does the heliosphere-LISM interaction work, and what is the nature of the LISM, including magnetic fields and contemporary interstellar dust composition, diversity, density and size distribution? 

In situ measurements of interstellar dust moving through the solar system provide unique ground truth information, but they have also been puzzling the community: they are not yet understood in the frame of dust dynamics simulations - related to the heliosphere properties. Also Voyager measurements at the heliosphere boundary kept surprising and challenging our views on the outer heliosphere to the very fundamental level. 

ASTRODUST will combine unique in situ interstellar dust observations in the solar system, with interstellar dust trajectory simulations that are coupled to a dynamic heliosphere, including its boundary regions and the ISM. ASTRODUST will build a synergy between two fields (heliosphere, dust) in order to answer fundamental questions about the dust and the heliosphere-LISM interaction. With ASTRODUST, we use a new way to explore and understand our local galactic neighbourhood. It also serves as an essential step towards understanding galaxy evolution (via the dust), how stars interact with their surroundings (astrospheres), and the history and future of the solar system on its continuous journey through the galaxy.

Horizon 2020,PeVSPACE,Direct Detection of TeV--PeV Cosmic Rays in Space,"The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) mission has recently marked a new epoch in astroparticle physics, extending the direct measurements of cosmic ray spectra beyond a TeV with unprecedented energy resolution. With this project, based on my leadership position in DAMPE and its unique data, I propose to fundamentally improve the precision of direct cosmic ray measurements at the highest energies – in the TeV–PeV range, using for the first time a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence approach. The project will help to solve the century-long problem of cosmic-ray origin at such high energies and its effects on the Universe composition. It will study the cosmic-ray spectrum close to the region of a mysterious decline, so-called “knee”, and shed light on the nature of Dark Matter through the discovery of characteristic fine structures in cosmic-ray and gamma-ray spectra. To achieve this, based on my expertise I propose: i) to develop the TeV–PeV cosmic-ray track reconstruction and identification techniques, using a deep learning or similar artificial intelligence approach; ii) to set up a unique research programme to iteratively improve the precision of hadronic Monte-Carlo models in this rarely explored energy domain, based on the available DAMPE data and data from future experiments. The developed results will be applied to the processing of DAMPE data at the first stage, and will be then extended to the next generation High Energy Cosmic Radiation Detection (HERD) experiment. The research strategy is designed to reduce drastically the dominant uncertainties of the cosmic-ray measurements in space, related to the particle type/direction identification and modeling of hadronic interactions in the detector. As a result of the project, cosmic ray spectra will be directly measured in space in TeV–PeV energy range with qualitatively higher precision, opening up an unprecedented opportunities for new discoveries.",Andrii Tykhonov,University of Geneva,Switzerland,-,851103,ERC-2019-STG,Starting Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE9 - Universe Sciences,2019,43862,45991,1499097,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/851103,University of Geneva
Horizon 2020,SCORE,Signal Correction to Reveal other Earths,"Searching for life signatures on another planet is one of the key endeavours of astrophysics and today, we are in a unique position to make this possible. The TESS satellite, which just started observing, will find the first Earth-twins orbiting bright stars, which will allow follow-up studies with JWST and ELTs to characterize the atmosphere of those exoplanets. However, TESS will only measure the radius of the detected Earth-twins, which is not enough to interpret the spectroscopic features in their atmospheres. The mass is also required, and it can be obtained using the radial-velocity (RV) technique, which measures the gravitational influence of an exoplanet on its host star.  To measure the mass of the Earth-twins that TESS will detect, the community have built incredible RV instruments that can reach a RV precision of 0.25 m/s (ESPRESSO commissioning). Such an extreme precision is required to measure the tiny signature of an Earth-twin, however, this is without considering the perturbing signals induced by its host star, by Earth’s atmosphere and by instrumental noise. Indeed, we know that these perturbing signals mask completely the signal induced by an Earth-twin, and now that the RV instruments have the sensitivity to detect such planets, it is urgent to develop novel methods for mitigating the different perturbing signals. Understanding the different perturbing signals is extremely challenging and require incredible data. The PI have built two telescopes that feed Sun-light into the best RV instruments. The obtained data are of exceptional quality, and the goal of SCORE is to analyse them, explore novel promising methods for mitigating the different perturbing signals and find the tiny signatures of Earth and Venus. This will open the way towards the mass-measurement of Earth-twins, which is essential in the quest for finding life elsewhere, but also to understand planetary formation and dynamics.

Horizon 2020,LSSgrav,Testing the law of gravity with novel large-scale structure observables,"The objective of my proposal is to test the law of gravity using the large-scale structure of our Universe. The way galaxies are distributed in the sky, as well as their observed size and shape, are directly sensitive to the theory of gravity. Upcoming large-scale structure surveys are expected to deliver very precise pictures of our sky over a wide range of scale and redshift, opening the way to a whole new range of tests of gravity. The aim of my project is to construct novel cosmological observables to test fundamental properties of gravity that are not accessible through standard large-scale structure analyses. With these observables, I will probe two distinct but complementary regimes of the large-scale structure.

First, I will construct new tests of gravity at large scales. In this regime, observables are affected by relativistic distortions that deform our image of the sky. The goal of my research is to construct novel, innovative methods to isolate these distortions and use them to probe some features of gravity that are not encoded in standard tests.

Second, I will probe gravity at small scales, in the non-linear regime of large-scale structure. The non-linear regime contains complementary information about the nature of gravitational interactions. I will use a novel observable, the line correlation function, to probe these interactions. This observable is sensitive to correlations in the phases of the galaxy density field and grant us access to information that is not included in standard statistical measures like the two-point correlation function. 

The new cosmological observables constructed in this project will allow us to go beyond standard large-scale structure analyses, and to test in a model-independent way specific properties of gravity that have never been tested before at cosmological scales.",Camille Françoise Bonvin,University of Geneva,Switzerland,-,863929,ERC-2019-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE9 - Universe Sciences,2019,44136,45961,1946064,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/863929,University of Geneva
Horizon 2020,STAREX,STARs at the EXtreme,"The first stars in the Universe are extreme objects. Extreme in their composition: they are made of material having been processed only by the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and having a content in dark matter likely very different from the one of the present-day stars. Extreme in their properties: one of the most important properties is their mass that might reach values as high as even 100 000 solar masses (supermassive black-hole seeds). Their properties may differ from the today massive star populations also by their likely fast axial spins, the processes of mass loss, their magnetic fields, multiplicity. Extreme in their physics: born in over densities made mainly by dark matter, the physics of candidate dark matter particles may have a significant effect on their evolution and produce what has been called dark or frozen stars, i.e. stars sustained by dark-matter particle annihilation. The aim of STAREX is to determine which observable features can be used to constrain the composition (baryonic and dark matter), the properties (masses, rotation, magnetic field, multiplicity) and the physics of the first stars in the Universe. These observables will be collected by present-day and future facilities as, for instance, the JWST, ELT, adLigo, VIRGO, LISA and are linked to ionising fluxes, nucleosynthesis, radiation of both stellar populations and transient events, and gravitational waves. STAREX will explore new physical processes, build and use new numerical tools, provide observables that will account together for a sophisticated description of the physics of individual stars, single or in binary systems, and for the dynamics of the stars in the first stellar clusters. STAREX is at the crossroad of topics such as stellar physics, nucleosynthesis, hydrodynamics, evolution of galaxies, and will potentially engender ground-braking consequences for observational cosmology, astrophysics and even fundamental physics (fluid dynamics, dark matter properties).",Georges Emile Meynet,University of Geneva,Switzerland,-,833925,ERC-2018-ADG,Advanced Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE9 - Universe Sciences,2018,43831,45657,2500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/833925,University of Geneva
Horizon 2020,TRIPLE,Three Indirect Probes of Lyman continuum LEakage from galaxies,"Cosmic reionization corresponds to the period in the history of the Universe during which the predominantly neutral intergalactic medium was ionised by the emergence of the first luminous sources.  Young stars in primeval galaxies may be the sources of reionization, if the ionising radiation, called Lyman continuum (LyC), that they produce can escape their interstellar medium: the escape fraction of LyC photons from galaxies is one of the main unknowns of reionization studies. This ERC project will contribute to answer this question, by computing from simulated galaxies three indirect diagnostics of LyC leakage that were recently reported in the literature, and comparing the virtual observables with the direct escape of LyC photons from simulated galaxies, and with observations. The first diagnostic for LyC leakage relates the escape of the strongly resonant Lyman-alpha radiation from galaxies to the LyC escape. It was proposed by the PI (Verhamme et al. 2015), and recently validated by observations (Verhamme et al. 2016). The second diagnostic proposes that the strength of Oxygen lines ratios can trace density-bounded interstellar regions. It was the selection criterion for the successful detection of 5 strong Lyman Continuum Emitters from our team (Izotov 2016a,b). The third diagnostic relates the metallic absorption line strengths to the porosity of the absorbing interstellar gas in front of the stars. The increasing opacity of the intergalactic medium with redshift renders direct LyC detections impossible during reionisation. Indirect methods are the only probes of LyC leakage in the distant Universe, and the proposed diagnostics will soon become observables at the redshifts of interest with JWST. They have passed the validation tests, it is now urgent to calibrate these indicators on state-of-the art simulations of galaxy formation.

Horizon 2020,EXOKLEIN,The Climates and Habitability of Small Exoplanets Around Red Stars,"The detection of life beyond our Solar System is possible only via the remote sensing of the atmospheres of exoplanets.  The recent discovery that small exoplanets are common around cool, red stars offers an exciting opportunity to study the atmospheres of Earth-like worlds.  Motivated by this revelation, the EXOKLEIN project proposes to construct a holistic climate framework to understand astronomical observations in the context of the atmosphere, geochemistry and biosignatures of the exoplanet.  The proposed research is divided into three major themes.  Research Theme 1 aims to construct a virtual laboratory of an atmosphere that considers atmospheric dynamics, chemistry and radiation, as well as how they interact.  This virtual laboratory enables us to understand the physical and chemical mechanisms involved, as well as predict the observed properties of an exoplanet.  Research Theme 2 aims to generalize the carbonate-silicate cycle (also known as the long-term carbon cycle) by considering variations in rock composition, water acidity and atmospheric conditions.  The carbonate-silicate cycle is important because it regulates the long-term presence of carbon dioxide (a vital greenhouse gas) in atmospheres.  We also aim to investigate the role of the cycle in determining the fates of ocean-dominated exoplanets called “water worlds”.  Research Theme 3 aims to investigate the long-term stability of biosignature gases in the context of the climate.  Whether a gas uniquely indicates the presence of biology on an exoplanet depends on the atmospheric properties and ultraviolet radiation environment.  We investigate three prime candidates for biosignature gases: methyl chloride, dimethylsulfide and ammonia.  Overall, the EXOKLEIN project will significantly advance our understanding of whether the environments of rocky exoplanets around red stars are stable and conducive for life, and whether the tell-tale signatures of life may be detected by astronomers.",Kevin Heng,University of Bern,Switzerland,-,771620,ERC-2017-COG,Consolidator Grants,Physical sciences & engineering (PE),PE9 - Universe Sciences,2017,43132,44957,1984729,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/771620,University of Berne
Horizon 2020,COSMICLENS,Cosmology with Strong Gravitational Lensing,"Measuring cosmological distances has revolutionized our understanding of the Universe, and is still doing so! Early work in the 1920s led to the discovery of the expansion of the Universe. More precise distance measurements in the 90s with type-Ia supernovae revealed that this expansion is accelerating, with crucial consequences in cosmology and physics. Is the acceleration due to some repulsive form of dark energy? To Einstein's cosmological constant? Do we need to consider new physics? Answering these fundamental questions requires a precise measurement of the Hubble parameter, H0, which is my goal using the time delay (TD) method in strongly lensed quasars.The TD method exploits well-known physics on galaxy-scales. It is one of the very few techniques that can yield H0 to <2% using a single methodology. It involves no calibration, and is truly independent of any other cosmological probe. Capitalizing on the successful pathfinders COSMOGRAIL (PI: Courbin) and H0LiCOW (PI: Suyu, CoI: Courbin) time has come to fully exploit TDs with an observational, modeling and technical boost, organized in 2 phases. Phase I will secure H0 to 2% using the current chain of analysis, with feasible enhancements beyond the current state-of the-art. This will confirm or refute the tension seen between H0 values with different cosmological probes. Phase II targets 1% precision, improving the FoM of Stage-IV cosmological surveys by 40%.

Horizon 2020,AGRIMKT,Improving Market Access for Farmers: Evidence from East Africa,"Agriculture employs the majority of the labor force in many developing countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Increasing efficiency of agricultural production is a crucial step to foster economic development. Limited access to both input and output markets is widely considered a major obstacle to technology adoption and, in turn, to agricultural productivity. 

In this proposal, I outline a research program that focuses on improving farmers’ market access in East Africa. The research builds on the expertise I have developed on these topics over the last ten years.

The research program consists of three related projects. In Project A, we will use a randomized experiment to evaluate the impact of a holistic approach to improve market access: contract farming. The prevalence of contract farming arrangements in the developing world is growing. However, so far, there is no experimental evidence on their impact. We have established a partnership with a large contract farming company in Kenya, which has agreed to randomize the order in which it will expand to new villages.

In Project B, we will study how to increase demand for crop insurance among smallholders. Building on previous successful experimental work, we will test i) whether offering pay-at-harvest insurance, as opposed to upfront premium pay, raises take-up, ii) which behavioral mechanisms may drive such response, and iii) whether pay-at-harvest can foster sustained insurance demand over multiple crop seasons. 

In Project C, we will combine parcel-level proprietary data for three decades that we obtained from a large agribusiness company with land registry data to study the determinants and impact of land market access for smallholders.

The research program will generate new insights on how to improve access to key markets for agricultural producers. We expect the findings of the study will generate high interest among academics, development practitioners, and policymakers.

Horizon 2020,AUTOMATION,AUTOMATION AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION: A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT,"Since the invention of the spinning frame, automation has been one of the drivers of economic growth. Yet, workers, economist or the general public have been concerned that automation may destroy jobs or create inequality. This concern is particularly prevalent today with the sustained rise in economic inequality and fast technological progress in IT, robotics or self-driving cars. The empirical literature has showed the impact of automation on income distribution. Yet, the level of wages itself should also affect the incentives to undertake automation innovations. Understanding this feedback is key to assess the long-term effect of policies. My project aims to provide the first quantitative account of the two-way relationship between automation and the income distribution.It is articulated around three parts. First, I will use patent data to study empirically the causal effect of wages on automation innovations. To do so, I will build firm-level variation in the wages of the customers of innovating firms by exploiting variations in firms’ exposure to international markets. Second, I will study empirically the causal effect of automation innovations on wages. There, I will focus on local labour market and use the patent data to build exogenous variations in local knowledge. Third, I will calibrate an endogenous growth model with firm dynamics and automation using Danish firm-level data. The model will replicate stylized facts on the labour share distribution across firms. It will be used to compute the contribution of automation to economic growth or the decline of the labour share. Moreover, as a whole, the project will use two different methods (regression analysis and calibrated model) and two different types of data, to answer questions of crucial policy importance such as: Taking into account the response of automation, what are the long-term effects on wages of an increase in the minimum wage, a reduction in labour costs, or a robot tax?",David Hémous,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,805007,ERC-2018-STG,Starting Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),"SH1 - Individuals, Markets & Organisations",2018,43405,45777,1295890,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/805007,University of Zurich
Horizon 2020,CONTROL,Behavioral Foundations of Power and Control,"Power relations are an integral part of economic organizations, as well as political and social institutions. People exercise power over others – or are exposed to the power of others – in government, in firms, and even in families. People care deeply about power and autonomy, and attitudes towards them have important economic and societal consequences. Examples include such diverse matters as the willingness to delegate power to government, empire building in public organizations, or sorting into more or less autonomous jobs. Despite their importance, we have remarkably little knowledge about preferences for power and autonomy. Clearly, power and autonomy are valued for being instrumental in achieving desirable outcomes, but it has also long been argued that they are valuable for their own sake. Existing value measures of power and autonomy, however, fail to distinguish between intrinsic and instrumental value components. Power distance and autonomy are even considered to be cultural values, but we don’t know whether differences in such measures are rooted in differences in the instrumental value or differences in preferences. We propose a novel revealed preference approach that allows us to address this shortcoming by separately measuring the intrinsic value of power and the intrinsic value of autonomy. We can then apply this method to properly assess heterogeneity in such values within and across cultures. By combining our measures with other data, we will be able to study the importance of such preferences in explaining individual differences, such as occupational choices or expressed political views, as well as economic outcomes across countries, such as the level of decentralization in economic organizations. Finally, we will study how behavioral reactions to power interact with such preferences and organizational structure, in order to better understand how institutions can be efficiently designed when behavioral reactions to power are accounted for.",Holger Herz,University of Fribourg,Switzerland,-,803332,ERC-2018-STG,Starting Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),"SH1 - Individuals, Markets & Organisations",2018,43525,45535,1492785,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/803332,University of Fribourg
Horizon 2020,VALURED,Value Judgments and Redistribution Policies,"Heterogeneity and diversity are a pervasive aspect of modern societies. Differences in individuals’ preferences, needs, skills, and information are key to explain variation in individuals’ behavior and to anticipate individuals’ responses to policy changes. There is no consensus, however, about how to take these differences into account when evaluating policies.

Project VALURED will reexamine this ethical challenge by characterizing the mapping between value judgments—i.e. principles of distributive justice—and redistribution policies. This mapping is tremendously important for welfare analysis and policy design. First, it associates the most desirable policy to each set of value judgments, providing an “ethical menu” to policy design. Second, it gives an ethical identity of each policy proposal, that is, it identifies the value judgments a policymaker endorses when proposing a specific policy.

The main objectives of VALURED are to:
1) identify transparent and compelling value judgments that accommodate heterogeneity and diversity;
2) show the implications of these value judgments for the evaluation and design of redistribution policies; 
3) characterize welfare criteria that respect individuals’ preferences and account for individuals’ differences in needs, skills, and information; 
4) provide new insights for the design of income, capital, and inheritance taxation; 
5) develop simple formulas that express optimal policies as a function of observable heterogeneity and ethical parameters.

Horizon 2020,DEVTAXNET,Tax Evasion in Developing Countries. The Role of Firm Networks,"Tax evasion leads to billions of Euros of losses in government revenue around the world. This does not only affect public budgets, but can also create large distortions between activities that are fully taxed and others that escape taxation through evasion. These issues are particularly severe in developing countries, where evasion is especially high and governments struggle to raise funds for basic services and infrastructure, while at the same time trying to grow independent of international aid.It is widely suspected that some of the most common and difficult to detect forms of evasion involve interactions across firm networks. However, due to severe data limitations, the existing literature has mostly considered taxpayers as isolated units. Empirical evidence on tax compliance in firm networks is extremely sparse.This proposal describes 3 Sub-Projects to fill this gap. They are made possible thanks to access I have obtained -through five years of prior research and policy engagement– to unique datasets from Chile and Ecuador on both the networks of supply chains and of joint ownership structures.The first Sub-Project focuses on international firm networks. It aims to analyze profit shifting of multinational firms to low tax jurisdictions, exploiting a natural experiment in Chile that strongly increased monitoring of international tax norms.The second Sub-Project investigates the analogous issue at the intranational level: profit shifting and tax collusion in networks of firms within the same country. Despite much anecdotal evidence, this behavior has received little rigorous empirical scrutiny.The final Sub-Project is situated at the nexus between international and national firms. It seeks to estimate a novel form of spillovers of FDI: the impact on tax compliance of local trading partners of foreign-owned firms.DEVTAXNET will provide new insights about the role of firm networks for tax evasion that are valuable to academics and policy makers alike.",Dina Deborah Pomeranz,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,758984,ERC-2017-STG,Starting Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),"SH1 - Individuals, Markets & Organisations",2017,43101,44926,1288125,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/758984,University of Zurich
Horizon 2020,IneqPol,Inequality - Public Policy and Political Economy,"Over the past decades, many developed countries have seen considerable increases in income and wealth inequality. Political and economic arguments for and against offsetting this rise in inequality have been put forward. This research program aims at informing this debate by developing new models that capture these trends and by analyzing their optimal policy implications, both theoretically and quantitatively. The goal is to bring together approaches from public economics, labor economics, macroeconomics, and political economy to explore whether rising inequality necessitates institutional responses and, if so, which ones. This project will shed light on this question from the following three related angles: (1) The changing nature of labor markets and its implications for inequality and tax policy. This part will focus on technological progress (e.g. the replacement of routine tasks) and shifts in the sectoral composition of the economy (e.g. the rise of finance) and what this means for the taxation of labor incomes, profits, and the desirability of basic income policies. (2) The intergenerational dynamics of inequality and the design of tax and public spending policies to promote economic mobility. We will develop a normative framework for optimal policies that balance both equality of opportunity principles and efficient parental sorting based on preference heterogeneity over public spending (e.g. on schools). (3) Wealth inequality and its implications for the political economy of tax policy. This part will incorporate capital taxation into the analysis and explore how it can help promote political stability, both when equilibrium taxes depend on the distribution of wealth in society and, conversely, when political influence correlates with wealth. This research project aims both to develop new theoretical tools and to implement them empirically, with an emphasis on the implications for the design of real-world tax policies.",Florian Scheuer,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,757721,ERC-2017-STG,Starting Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),"SH1 - Individuals, Markets & Organisations",2017,43132,45138,1008665,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/757721,University of Zurich
Horizon 2020,COMPASS,"Is environmental justice necessary for human well-being? Comparative analysis of certification schemes, inclusive business, and solidarity economy strategies","Unprecedented concentration in agri-food value chains is reinforcing global inequality. Waves of land grabbing threaten the livelihoods of millions. Reshaping the effects of agricultural investment, land use, and trade on human well-being is thus an urgent challenge. Certification schemes (CS) such as “Fairtrade” have become a common strategy to meet this challenge. However, accumulating evidence shows that many CS have limited effects on well-being. Inclusive business (IB) and solidarity economy (SE) strategies are emerging alternatives. Inclusiveness and solidarity are widely believed to enhance well-being, but evidence and theories disprove this common belief. Environmental justice may be a necessary condition to understand and reshape the effects of CS, IB, and SE on well-being. However, lack of reliable data and comparative analyses limits understanding of these links. COMPASS will tackle these challenges. This project aims to demonstrate how environmental justice influences the effects of CS, IB, and SE strategies on human well-being. COMPASS is organized in four work packages (WPs) and focuses on the cocoa and coffee sectors of Peru and Switzerland. WP1 surveys organizations (n=120) to compare their instruments used in CS, IB, and SE strategies. WP2 surveys households (n=840) and uses set-theoretic and process-tracing methodology to explain the effects of CS, IB, and SE on well-being. WP3 identifies the rules that organizations (n=18) create to regulate land use, investment and trade, assesses their environmental justice, and explains how they influence well-being. WP4 generates context-sensitive generalizations of these effects, and it tests and advances pertinent theories. COMPASS breaks new ground by systematically comparing CS, IB, and SE strategies and their effects on human well-being. It develops a new strand of environmental justice research on private-sector strategies and it tests the transformative potential of environmental justice.",Christoph Oberlack,University of Bern,Switzerland,-,949852,ERC-2020-STG,Starting Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),"SH2 - Institutions, Governance & Legal Systems",2020,44256,46081,1499250,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/949852,University of Berne
Horizon 2020,GREENFIN,Effective green financial policies for the low-carbon transition,"Mitigating dangerous climate change requires a fundamental transition of global economies. This transition calls for an annual investment of 2–4 trillion USD, which is a multiple of current climate investment. Accordingly, the EU and many countries are enacting green financial policies, intervening in the financial sector to improve financing conditions for low-carbon technologies. Examples include green state investment banks, carbon disclosure requirements, and changes to lending regulations. However, the effect of these financial policies on investments in non-financial sectors such as energy, transport, or building is largely unknown. More specifically, we lack insights on how different low-carbon technologies require different types of finance (such as public vs. private finance, corporate vs. project finance, or equity vs. debt). Hence, it remains unclear how to make best use of such policies to fill the climate finance gap. By bridging disciplines and using novel data, GREENFIN will lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of the effects of financial policies on the low-carbon transition in non-financial sectors, and thereby lay the foundations for a new interdisciplinary field of financial policy analysis. First, combining theory from technology innovation studies and financial economics, I will derive how technology-inherent characteristics predict the demand for different types of finance. Second, using policy analysis tools and novel machine learning-based methods, I will analyze the effects of green financial policies on the supply of various types of finance. Third, combining these insights I will deliver specific recommendations for designing more effective green financial policies in the EU and beyond. By including financial policies in policy mix analyses, GREENFIN will crucially increase the overall analytical power of public policy analysis, which is all the more important given the ever-growing role of the financial sector in modern economies.",Bjarne Steffen,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,948220,ERC-2020-STG,Starting Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),"SH2 - Institutions, Governance & Legal Systems",2020,44197,46022,1499771,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/948220,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,SUSTAINFORESTS,"Tropical forest patches under pressure: Dynamics, functions and sustainable management in agricultural landscapes of the West African forest and savannah zones","Tropical forest patches in agricultural landscapes are the survivors of a hard-to-reverse deforestation process. Yet, these patches, which are spread over West Africa, still provide crucial ecological functions, serve as habitats for biodiversity, contribute globally to carbon sinks, and are important for the livelihoods of local populations. Given their persistent degradation, identifying pathways to safeguard or even increase their contribution to ecological function and thus to sustainable development is crucial. While existing theories of agricultural expansion, intensification, and forest transition explain agriculture-induced deforestation well, they do not explain the persistence of forest patches in a context of agricultural expansion. Little or no research has analysed forest patches in the highly fragmented agricultural landscapes of the rainforest and savannah zones of West Africa. This project will analyse the interactive roles of forest patches in the agricultural landscapes of these zones in Togo, Benin, Nigeria, and Cameroon. In addition, it will investigate conditions under which various biophysical, socio-cultural, economic, and institutional factors, including decision-making and land users’ behaviour and interests, interact with and affect forest patches and their sustainable use, management, and governance. Focussing on forest patches in West Africa thus closes theoretical and empirical gaps. The project will apply an iterative landscape- and people-centred approach that integrates data from remote sensing, social surveys, and participatory modelling. It will employ content analysis, multivariate statistics, and spatial analysis methods. Results will clarify the theories underpinning forest patches and open new research avenues in the sustainability sciences. Insights gained from the project will inform and trigger region-wide efforts to preserve forest patches and help initiate transformative actions on sustainable land and forest management.",Chinwe Ijeoma Ifejika Speranza,University of Bern,Switzerland,-,101001200,ERC-2020-COG,Consolidator Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),"SH2 - Institutions, Governance & Legal Systems",2020,44348,46173,1998512,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101001200,University of Berne
Horizon 2020,TRADE LAW 4.0,Trade Law for the Data-Driven Economy,"Data has been conceptualized as the ‘new oil’ and although this is a flawed statement, it catches well the value attached to data as a driver of economic growth and innovation, and as a force of change in all facets of societal life. Accordingly, data has emerged as an important topic in contemporary law and policy—on the one hand, because it is critical to understand whether and how different societal areas have been affected by digital transformations, including disruptive phenomena like Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and on the other hand, because governance toolkits, including legal rules, need to adapt to reflect these implications. Despite the urgency attached to both tasks and the intensified mobilization of policy and research efforts to address them, the topic of data-driven transformation has been explored in a fragmented manner. The domain of trade law has been particularly slow to react—neither do we have a full understanding of the impact of digitization on the entire body of global trade rules, nor have we seen legal adaptation. To put it plainly, despite living in times of industries 4.0, we have trade rules grounded at 1.0.
The project addresses these flaws by conducting research in three interrelated fields that seek to: (1) enhance our understanding of the implications of digital disruption for trade law and vice versa, including through a thorough analysis of all existing trade rules that matter for data, as it flows across borders and is regulated domestically; (2) boost our toolkits for tackling the tensions inherent to the data-driven economy by mapping and analyzing all available mechanisms for reconciling economic and non-economic objectives, with a strong focus on data protection but including also other values, such as freedom of speech, that may be important for national constituencies; and ultimately, (3) suggest design for trade law that can be sustainable in an environment of fluid technological change.",Tihomira Burri,University of Lucerne,Switzerland,-,101003216,ERC-2020-COG,Consolidator Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),"SH2 - Institutions, Governance & Legal Systems",2020,44440,46265,1600975,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101003216,University of Lucerne
Horizon 2020,EUROBORD,Bordering Europe: Boundary Formation and European Integration,"Integration crises and geopolitical shifts have put the borders of the European Union (EU) in the focus of attention and contestation. Current developments highlight how strongly European integration is affected by outside events and cross-border transactions. Yet theories of European integration focus almost exclusively on the internal boundaries between the member states. EUROBORD therefore develops and tests a novel ‘bordering theory’ aiming to explain how external boundary developments affect the trajectory of integration.

The bordering theory proposes an account of how ‘bordering’ – the making and configuration of the EU’s boundaries – affects ‘ordering’: the structure of politics and institutions in the EU. Specifically, it analyses how ‘debordering’ (the expansion, opening and incongruence of the EU’s boundaries) in the post-Cold War period has generated integration problems and political conflicts, which have triggered a process of ‘rebordering’ (retrenchment or closure) in turn. EUROBORD examines the conditions and mechanisms that lead to alternative configurations of the EU’s boundaries.

EUROBORD introduces innovative conceptual frameworks, automated data collection techniques and new datasets to map the changing configuration of EU borders and study their effects on (i) economic, cultural, political and military transactions across these boundaries, (ii) member state political performance, (iii) European party positions and conflict, and (iv) boundary policies and the trajectory of European integration. This comprehensive data allows EUROBORD to conduct the first systematic empirical study of the effects of external bordering in European integration, using a mix of panel analyses and case studies. EUROBORD will thereby generate a more complete and adequate understanding of the dynamics of European integration and provide insights on the political causes and effects of border design.",Frank Schimmelfennig,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,101018300,ERC-2020-ADG,Advanced Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),"SH2 - Institutions, Governance & Legal Systems",2020,44501,46326,2477206,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101018300,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,JustCity,The Just City: The Ciceronian Conception of Justice and Its Reception in the Western Tradition,"One of the most innovative, and historically most influential, notions in the Western debate about justice is the political theory of Cicero (106-43 BCE). This project examines the ways a Ciceronian conception of justice came to be used in political argument at specific inflection points in the history of political thought. Ciceronian justice, responding to the breakdown of order, marked a significant departure from earlier Greek theories of justice. Cicero’s law-centered views on justice, both within and between states, were conceived against moral skepticism and shaped the later history of Western political thought in crucial ways.

Cicero’s contribution has been obscured by philological trends keen on crediting Cicero’s political and ethical thought to Greek predecessors, on the one hand, and by the recent historiography on republicanism on the other. Neither of these can answer satisfyingly why Cicero’s legalized conception of justice has impacted Western political theory so thoroughly. How and why did Cicero distinguish his notion of justice from his predecessors? How did his conception come to influence both theory and institutions of justice until the enlightenment and beyond?

The project challenges conventional views by focusing on crucial crossroads Cicero’s conception of justice faced from its inception in the late Roman Republic to early modern Europe. Bringing an innovative focus on the longue durée to the topic and bringing together methodological tools from intellectual history, ancient history and philosophy, and legal history, the project provides a deep historical perspective of Cicero’s conception of justice and its later reception. This reinterpretation of the intellectual history of justice in the West reevaluates the historical logic of Ciceronian justice, showing how and why this theory of justice came to play a crucial role in the European heritage by harnessing the reception of classical antiquity to long-term intellectual history.",Benjamin Straumann,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,864309,ERC-2019-COG,Consolidator Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),"SH2 - Institutions, Governance & Legal Systems",2019,44105,45930,1775000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/864309,University of Zurich
Horizon 2020,RevACLaw,Revamping Anticorruption Criminal Law – Strategies and Consequences,"Fighting transnational corporate corruption is today a global task, resulting in an increase in criminalisation. However, when it comes to law enforcement, prosecutors face major problems: fact-finding is hampered and gathering evidence from foreign jurisdictions by way of traditional mutual legal assistance is arduous, if not impossible. Despite these major difficulties, since 2000 the enforcement of anti-corruption norms has flourished, resulting in multi-jurisdictional criminal procedures. This change is due to the revamping of strategies in three major fields of law (substantive criminal law, procedural criminal law, mutual legal assistance in criminal matters), and the resulting cross-cutting dynamics. A hybrid model of corporate criminal justice has emerged, which was unthinkable in the past and still is in almost any other field of criminal justice. This heretofore insufficiently studied model has led to a new, opaque, and exclusive way of conducting criminal justice. RevACLAW’s ambitious objective is to provide a comprehensive conceptual framework for the study of revamping strategies, leading to a hybrid corporate criminal justice model, as well as the consequences resulting from such a mdoel. RevACLAW will focus on four jurisdictions (France, Switzerland, USA, and the UK), and its objectives are the following: (A) unveiling the revamping strategies and how they interact in the three fields of law mentioned, and conceptualising this new way of conducting justice as a social practice, (B) delivering both a theoretical and empirical analysis of the accessibility of the resulting settlements, and (C) analysing case-making and the occurring narratives of corporate corruption and anticorruption law enforcement. These objectives will be achieved by a novel interdisciplinary approach, including both legal and empirical research. This project will impact the fields of legal theory as well as the study of law and society with regard to a present-day phenomenon.",Nadia Capus,University of Neuchatel,Switzerland,-,864498,ERC-2019-COG,Consolidator Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),"SH2 - Institutions, Governance & Legal Systems",2019,44075,46112,1952689.98,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/864498,University of Neuchatel
Horizon 2020,PRODIGI,Problem Definition in the Digital Democracy,"How does an issue become a political problem? No issue inherently requires political responses. Instead, political actors construct arguments regarding the nature of a given problem and connect them to particular policy actions. For example, and to preview PRODIGI's substantive focus, some see digital technology as a threat to democracy and advocate for stricter regulation, while others emphasize its potential to improve participation and argue that tighter rules stifle innovation. This phenomenon, known as ""problem definition,"" has long been recognized as a fundamental aspect of any policymaking process. Theoretically, PRODIGI argues that the notion of problem definition needs to integrate the dynamics induced by digital technology, such as new forms of political communication that bypass traditional gatekeepers. The state of the art does not adequately describe these new dynamics. On the one hand, the literature on digital technology and politics has not explicitly recognized problem definition as a a key aspect. On the other hand, the agenda setting and problem definition literatures have not integrated the role of digital technology in their arguments. Specifically, PRODIGI pursues four objectives: 1) develop a theory of problem definition that accounts for the role of digital technology; 2) develop new methods to measure problem definition based on computational social science; 3) analyze problem definition in the case of policy responses to digital technology's implications for democracy; and 4) analyze the effects of problem definition on opinions using survey experiments. PRODIGI breaks new ground in two ways. First, it puts forward original theory and  methods to study a longstanding question that has acquired new relevance in digital environments. Second, it applies the new theory and methods to an important societal challenge, namely, how politics responds to digital technology's impact on democracy.",Fabrizio Gilardi,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,883121,ERC-2019-ADG,Advanced Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),"SH2 - Institutions, Governance & Legal Systems",2019,44197,46022,2483765,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/883121,University of Zurich
Horizon 2020,DISINTEGRATION,The Mass Politics of Disintegration,"In the past few years, there has been a growing popular backlash against international institutions. Examples include the 2015 Greek bailout referendum, the 2016 Brexit referendum, or the 2016 election of a US President seemingly determined to withdraw US support from various international treaties. The implications of these mass-based disintegration efforts reach far beyond the countries in which they originate. First, the disintegration process is shaped by how remaining member states respond to one member’s bid to unilaterally change or terminate the terms of an existing international agreement. Second, mass-based disintegration bids pose considerable political contagion risks by encouraging disintegrative tendencies in other countries. Unfortunately, our theoretical tools to understand such international disintegration processes are underdeveloped. DISINTEGRATION therefore conducts a broad, systematic, and comparative inquiry into the mass politics of disintegration that pays particular attention to reactions in the remaining member states. It explores when and how one country’s mass-based disintegration experience encourages or deters demands for disintegration in other countries, how these contagion effects are transmitted through domestic elites and domestic discourse, and how the remaining member states ultimately respond during disintegration negotiations. It undertakes large-scale multi-method data collection that exploits the research opportunities offered by two ongoing mass-based disintegration processes: the Brexit negotiations and an upcoming Swiss referendum aimed at terminating a Swiss-EU bilateral treaty. DISINTEGRATION’s main objective is to develop a much-needed theory of mass-based disintegration that helps us understand the transnational dynamics that unfold between governments, political elites and the mass public when one member state attempts to unilaterally withdraw from an international agreement on the basis of widespread popular support.",Stefanie Walter,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,817582,ERC-2018-COG,Consolidator Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),"SH2 - Institutions, Governance & Legal Systems",2018,43586,45777,1998626,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/817582,University of Zurich
Horizon 2020,CoCi,Co-Evolving City Life,"How could networks of innovative cities contribute to the solution of humanity’s existential problems? Given the on-going digital revolution and our present-day sustainability challenges, we have to reinvent the way cities are operated. We propose that the requirement of organizing cities in a more resilient way implies the need for more decentralized solutions, based on digitally assisted self-organization, and that this concept is also compatible with sustainability requirements and stronger democratic participation. The CoCi proposal will investigate, whether such a decentralized, participatory approach could compete with a fully centralized approach in terms of efficiency and sustainability, or perform even better than that. This requires in particular to figure out, how distributed co-creation processes can be coordinated and lifted to a professional level in a scalable way. The main questions of the CoCi proposal are: How could more participatory smart cities work, and how can they meet the requirements of being more efficient, sustainable and resilient? What are their risks and benefits compared with centralized approaches? How could digital societies fitting our culture, for example, based on values such as freedom, equality and solidarity (liberté, égalité, fraternité) look like, and what performance can be expected from them? The CoCi proposal brings together two research directions: first, the automation of mobility solutions based on the Internet of Things and Machine Learning approaches, as they have been pursued within the “smart cities” paradigm and, second, novel collaborative approaches as they have been recently discussed under labels such as participatory resilience, digital democracy, City Olympics, open source urbanism, and the “socio-ecological finance system”.",Dirk Helbing,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,833168,ERC-2018-ADG,Advanced Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),"SH2 - Institutions, Governance & Legal Systems",2018,44105,45930,2499500,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/833168,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,GLOBESCAPE,Enabling transformation: Linking design and land system science to foster place-making in peri-urban landscapes under increasing globalization,"Unprecedented urbanization is threatening landscape diversity, bringing along new social and environmental problems. Standardized business centers, single family residential areas and shopping malls displace highly productive agricultural land, while the culture and lifestyles of local communities become absorbed into the sphere of globalization. This dramatic uniformisation is nurtured by the ever increasing global human migration. People are losing their sense of place and their motivation to initiate change. Uniformed international landscapes start dominating peri-urban areas. The result is a tremendous increase in fragility of these new landscapes of the twenty-first century, calling for an active and creative landscape shaping process to secure the long-term provision of critical ecosystem services. Up until now, however, models and tools developed in land system science have not caught up with the needs to understand and ultimately foster humans’ capacities to shape their landscapes. This project will contribute to a next generation of tools and methods to foster the development of resilient landscapes. I suggest linking design and probabilistic modeling in a collaborative landscape development tool to enable the transformation of spaces into places. This unconventional approach is necessary to deal with the probabilistic nature of landscapes. Landscapes can only be defined by including the observer – a concept severally neglected in today’s research efforts. Anchored in four peri-urban case studies, the interdisciplinary experimental and modeling work will have impact far beyond predicting transformation pathways of peri-urban landscapes under increased globalization. The resulting methods and tool will redefine the status quo of current geodesign tools, promote novel ways of deliberative decision-making and governance, and ultimately support humans to intentionally transform peri-urban landscapes.",Adrienne Grêt-Regamey,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,757565,ERC-2017-STG,Starting Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),"SH2 - Institutions, Governance & Legal Systems",2017,43252,45077,1498106,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/757565,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,LIDD,Popular Sovereignty vs. the Rule of Law? Defining the Limits of Direct Democracy,"Should the people be allowed to vote on the adoption of immigration restrictions that violate international law? Should it be permissible to launch a citizens’ initiative demanding the reintroduction of the death penalty? May a proposal be put to a popular vote despite the fact that voters are not properly informed about its effects? With the mushrooming of direct-democratic instruments throughout Europe and the introduction of the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI), the relationship between popular sovereignty and the rule of law is set to become one of the defining political issues of our time. Yet despite their great practical relevance, the questions of where the legal limits of direct democracy should be drawn and how compliance with these limits should be reviewed have remained almost completely unexplored. This leaves a major gap in the research that has serious repercussions for the functionality and legitimacy of direct democracy.It is the ambitious objective of LIDD to provide the scientific basis for resolving this urgent challenge. By innovatively combining comparative legal analysis with both qualitative and quantitative methods from other social sciences, the project builds on the experience made with various direct-democratic mechanisms in order to develop general conclusions. Part 1 of LIDD distils a core of issues that is regarded as being beyond the reach of direct democracy across all European states and elaborates best practices that will help states define and apply the limits of direct democracy in a sensible way. Part 2 identifies common European minimum standards that institutional and procedural systems for reviewing compliance with these limits must satisfy and makes suggestions for improving these systems. Part 3 applies the findings from Parts 1 and 2 to the EU level; it shows how the admissibility requirements that an ECI must meet should be adapted and clarified and how the admissibility procedure could be improved.",Daniel Moeckli,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,772160,ERC-2017-COG,Consolidator Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),"SH2 - Institutions, Governance & Legal Systems",2017,43405,45412,1963935,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/772160,University of Zurich
Horizon 2020,NASTAC,Nationalist State Transformation and Conflict,"Scholars studying contemporary conflict and development have increasingly turned to the historical roots of state formation. Going beyond Tilly’s classical theory of state formation, the NASTAC project creates a new theory of nationalist state transformation that will be evaluated with historical maps and archival data extracted through machine learning. While much has been written about state formation and nationalism, there is currently no empirically verified theory that shows how nationalism transformed and keeps transforming state internal and external properties, and how post-nationalist mechanisms counteract this influence. Without such a framework it is difficult to know under what conditions partition or power sharing should be used to pacify conflict-ridden multi-ethnic states. The project contains four work packages (WPs). WP1 will investigate whether state penetration and the evolution of the size and shapes of states have interacted with warfare according to Tilly’s expectations. WP2 will develop our theory of nationalist state transformation showing how nationalism affected internal state reach and how it triggered external change, such as secession, unification and irredentism, and, in turn, how these processes interacted with, and modified, patterns of conflict. WP3 will apply the theory of nationalist state transformation to the post-1945 world and will analyze how it interacts with post-nationalist mechanisms, such as power sharing. WP4 will develop innovative methods that draw on recent advances in machine learning techniques, such as deep learning, in order to transform historical maps and documents into disaggregated and spatially explicit datasets with extensive historical scope.

Horizon 2020,MIC,"Migration in cities of the global South: drivers, interactions and socio-demographic consequences","Large scale rural-to-urban migration and associated urbanization in developing countries constitute an opportunity but also a risk for human development. In either case, urbanization may lead to increased international migration. Our understanding of the interactions between these two phenomena is constrained by the lack of evidence on subnational heterogeneity in international migration, and the traditional divide between internal and international flows in research. MIC provides the most comprehensive analysis of trends in both types of migration in more than 3000 cities and rural areas spanning all developing regions.  

We address three substantive research questions. In project A, we explore how internal and international migrations evolve over time across educational strata of population, the hierarchical distribution of settlements, and the national settings of urbanization. In project B, we examine why migration trends differ across these contexts. In project C, we investigate how migration transforms cities’ socio-demographic potential for human development. 

MIC is innovative in its global and comparative perspective on migration among metropolitan populations. This is enabled by the integration of spatial data and harmonized census records, creative use of indirect demographic estimation techniques, and advanced statistical methods for data analysis. Each of the three sub-projects has the potential for innovative results that are highly policy-relevant. Projects A & B will provide information on where and why we should expect increased international migration in rapidly urbanizing developing countries, and how this relates to the domestic movements. Project C identifies the consequences of migration for the processes of urbanization and human development. MIC will help governments to tailor their existing migration and development policies, to maximize the development impact of migration, and to make cities more sustainable.",Mathias Lerch,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,950065,ERC-2020-STG,Starting Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),SH3 - The Social World and its Diversity,2020,44378,46203,1499127,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/950065,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,SYNTHLIVES,Synthetic Lives: The Futures of Mining,"The global extractive industry is undergoing three critical transformations: first, the advent of synthetic or lab-grown minerals, impacting the mining industry and the extraction of resources from nature; second, the creation of fully automated mining operations, seeking to render human work redundant or accessory to that of bots, drones, and other autonomous machines; third, the introduction of digital data and disintermediation technologies for mining management and traceability. Taken together, these innovations anticipate a future of mining that replaces nature with synthetic substances, human labor with intelligent machines, and intermediaries with unmediated accountability. This project responds to these changing conditions with a novel conceptualization of the emergent relationship entangling synthetic and natural objects, humans and machines, material and digital spaces: Synthetic Lives. It asks: What is the role of humans and non-human nature in increasingly synthetic, automated, and digital mining economies? This research innovates by bringing together three related areas of scholarly enquiry: i) resource materialities, to destabilize the divide between nature and culture; ii) mediation and technology, to problematize the separation between humans and machines; iii) algorithmic governance and digital transparency in mining sites, to untangle how material and digital properties are co-produced. Through a multi-sited and multi-methods study, it contributes to these fields of research in three case studies: synthetic laboratories, automated mines, and digital and data-driven mining processes. Interlacing these three foci, Synthetic Lives assists policy-making on environmental, employment, and social-digital issues, and inaugurates a debate of anthropological import: What are the political, epistemological, ecological, and economic consequences of a future that promises to be entangled in synthetic properties, autonomous machines, and digital technologies?

Horizon 2020,INTEGRATE,Identifying the Impact of Asylum Polices on Refugee Integration and Political Backlash in Host Communities,"Confronted with the largest refugee crisis since the Second World War, European governments are struggling with a complex and urgent question: how to best facilitate the integration of increasing numbers of refugees, while mitigating political conflict and native backlash in host communities? Despite the importance of this question, we lack reliable causal evidence of the impact of the asylum process and the consequences of most integration programs. The goal of INTEGRATE is two-fold. First, to provide systematic evidence that identifies the causal effects of the key parameters of the asylum process on the short and long-term economic, educational, health, political and social integration of refugees, their families, and children in five European countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland.  Specifically, INTEGRATE will examine the impact of wait times, labor market access, apprenticeship and training programs, early enrolment in language courses, integration contracts, welfare support, and family reunification policies on integration trajectories.  INTEGRATE will achieve this goal by utilizing quasi-experimental research designs and by combining the coverage of high-quality register panel data with comprehensive integration measures from targeted surveys. Second, INTEGRATE will assess whether effective integration programs alleviate hostility and moderate support for extreme-right parties in host communities by leveraging policy-induced temporal and spatial variation in integration success. In so doing, INTEGRATE endeavours to shed light on the potential of asylum and integration policies to improve social cohesion and lesson refugee-native conflict. In sum, the goal of INTEGRATE is to use causal research designs and innovative statistical methodology to comprehensively evaluate the asylum process in Europe, establishing an evidence base that can be used to redesign the asylum process to improve outcomes for both refugees and host societies.",Dominik Hangartner,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,804307,ERC-2018-STG,Starting Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),SH3 - The Social World and its Diversity,2018,43405,45230,1486730,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/804307,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,GANGS,"Gangs, Gangsters, and Ganglands: Towards a Global Comparative Ethnography","Gangs occupy a key position in the global imaginary of violence, widely perceived and represented as primary sources of brutality and insecurity. This can be related to the fact that they are one of a small number of truly global phenomena, found in almost every society across both time and space. At the same time, however, as almost 100 years of gang research have highlighted, the phenomenon can vary significantly in form, dynamics, and consequences. While there have been many insightful studies of gangs, the overwhelming majority have focused on a single group or location, and we still lack a proper sense of what kinds of gang dynamics might be general, and which ones are specific to particular times and places. The GANGS project will develop a systematic comparative investigation of global gang dynamics, to better understand why they emerge, how they evolve over time, whether they are associated with particular urban configurations, how and why individuals join gangs, and what impact this has on their potential futures. It will draw on original ethnographic research carried out in multiple locations, adopting an explicitly tripartite focus on “Gangs”, “Gangsters”, and “Ganglands” in order to better explore the interplay between group, individual, and contextual factors. The first will consider the organisational dynamics of gangs, the second will focus on individual gang members and their trajectories before, during, and after their involvement in a gang, while the third will reflect on the contexts within which gangs emerge and evolve. Research will combine innovative collaborative ethnography in Nicaragua, South Africa, and France, a ground-breaking comparison of 35 individual gang member life histories from across Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America, and unique joint ethnographic investigations into the political economy of three gang-affected cities in Nicaragua, France, and India.",Dennis Rodgers,Foundation for International Relations and Development Studies,Switzerland,-,787935,ERC-2017-ADG,Advanced Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),SH3 - The Social World and its Diversity,2017,43466,45473,2498079,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/787935,Foundation for International Relations and Development Studies
Horizon 2020,KNOWLEDGE MOVES,From the individual to the system: Understanding knowledge movement,"A major challenge of the Anthropocene is for individuals to adapt to rapidly changing environments. In long-lived species, adaptation will require successful innovations to spread efficiently through social units, emphasising an increasing role of social learning and culture. Given that humans are the most cultural species on the planet, what factors limit or enhance social transfer in other species?

Vervet monkeys are an ideal model species to study knowledge flow due to their social structure, with males migrating multiple times within their lifetime. Moreover, with the establishment of my field site, I am uniquely placed to conduct experiments on multiple groups. At the individual level, using innovative technology (bio-loggers and molecular tools), I will detect how males adjust to their new physical and social environment following migration with respect to dialects and diet, and respectively how groups adapt to migrants. To test how information spreads, I will conduct experiments using novel touchscreen technology to discover whether migrants always conform to their new group’s knowledge or if groups can learn from migrants. Quantitative models based on the vervet data will be constructed to capture information spread at group and population levels. Primates being living links to our past, comparing these models to the existing literature on humans will reveal to what extent social transmission seen in humans is common throughout the primate lineage, and what differences make human culture so unique.

By linking ground-breaking approaches in the wild with modelling work, this project will revolutionise our current knowledge of social information transmission within primate societies. Understanding information movement under changing environments will improve our ability to predict how primates will cope with the constantly increasing human impact and an unpredictable future, as well as refine our understanding of the uniqueness of cultural transfer in humans.",Erica Van De Waal,University of Lausanne,Switzerland,-,949379,ERC-2020-STG,Starting Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),SH4 - The Human Mind and its Complexity,2020,44197,46022,1500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/949379,University of Lausanne
Horizon 2020,ENGINE,Engineering Interdependence - A Window into the Evolution of the Human Mind,"The human mind is very similar to that of other great apes, yet also strikingly different, and a vast body of research converges on one conclusion: this gap is fundamentally social. Moreover, it emerges early in ontogeny, reflects the distinctly human neurochemical profile, and is characterized by physiological, hormonal, and behavioural synchronicity. But why did this gap evolve in the first place, and why was it us, rather than any of the other great apes, who diverged so dramatically and evolved this unique socio-cognitive niche? Multiple proposals stress interdependence as the key factor during human cognitive evolution, but testing this idea empirically remains a major challenge for the field. ENGINE sets out to do so, by proposing a process-oriented working model of human cognitive evolution in which interdependence takes centre stage, and testing it by engineering interdependence in the marmoset monkey, the emerging next-generation model for human social behaviour. I will thus produce an inter-dependent lineage of marmosets that will only be able to overcome daily challenges (i.e. finding food, defence against out-groups and predators, securing comfort) via mandatory cooperation, whereas an in-dependent lineage will have to overcome these challenges via individual effort. I will investigate downstream effects of this experimentally induced variation in interdependence on neurochemistry, synchronization at various levels, and cognitive outcomes. I will examine both immediate and long-term effects, when mandatory interdependence is experienced during ontogeny and over generations of animals. I will complement this engineering part by studies with human children, and validate it with wild marmosets. ENGINE thus allows us for the first time to comprehensively assess how interdependence affects socio-cognitive functioning in nonhuman primates, which brings us a crucial step forward in understanding how and why the human mind evolved.",Judith Burkart Natalucci,University of Zurich,Switzerland,-,101001295,ERC-2020-COG,Consolidator Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),SH4 - The Human Mind and its Complexity,2020,44470,47026,2000000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101001295,University of Zurich
Horizon 2020,PMSB,"Principles of Musical Structure Building: Theory, Computation, and Cognition","Music is a central human trait across all cultures and historical periods, involving a great rich variety of parameters, cognitive processes, and forms of structure building. The proposed project aims at advancing the understanding of human cognition and, specifically, the capacity to represent and process complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures by exploring the rich potential of music perception.Building on the PI’s previous work, this interdisciplinary research programme will be divided into three core strands:(A) The theoretical strand will be devoted to the investigation of formal principles that govern musical syntax and structure building in Western and non-Western music. Many current approaches share the expressive power of (tree-based) context-free grammars and are mostly confined to harmonic syntax only. Therefore, they face difficulty in expressing certain crucial syntactic phenomena in music. To address this lacuna, the theoretical strand will develop a novel unified theory of musical syntax that exceeds context-free complexity and reconciles harmonic structure with the constraints of voice leading within a single coherent framework.(B) Addressing the lack of machine-readable corpora in music research, a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses will be compiled and published in the context of the project’s computational strand. Further, the unified syntax theory will be implemented based on a generalized parsing approach and graph grammars, and trained and evaluated using the analytical corpus. (C) The formal framework developed in (A) entails specific predictions about mental representations of musical structure that will be empirically tested in the experimental strand of the project. Particular focus will be on aspects of nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, revision, and tension. The outcomes of the project will make a significant contribution to both the field of music cognition and to the cognitive sciences in general.",Martin Rohrmeier,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL),Switzerland,-,760081,ERC-2017-STG,Starting Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),SH4 - The Human Mind and its Complexity,2017,43160,45777,1500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/760081,EPF Lausanne
Horizon 2020,GLOBECOSAL,Global Economies of Salvation. Art and the Negotiation of Sanctity in the Early Modern Period,"GLOBECOSAL investigates how artworks were employed in the process of negotiating sanctity with the Roman Curia in the age of Iberian hegemony by examining the artworks produced with regard to the pioneers of Catholic blesseds and saints in the post-Tridentine ‘global’ context. As the cult of the saints was among the key conceptual battlegrounds in the conflict between the Catholic church and the Protestants, in the post-Tridentine period, saints came to fulfill spiritual, ideological and propagandistic purposes. Art history has paid heightened attention to the adherence of artworks to the models of sanctity formulated by the Tridentine church, leading to an overall neglect of competing local constructions of sanctity, a shortfall particularly momentous with regard to blesseds and saints connected in different ways to the process of European expansion, specifically to the Iberian empires.
The hypothesis under examination is that the artworks produced in relation to gaining recognition by the Church of saints first venerated in newly Christianized territories reveal an underlying negotiation of the local Catholic communities’ spiritual status within universal Catholicism. As official recognition affirmed the society which had made a saint its own, artworks related to this process served purposes of self-representation within the broader framework of social identity formation. 
GLOBECOSAL traces the circulation of material objects and iconographies within and between global networks of knowledge transmission, and combines this approach with a hypothetical ‘global market of symbolic values’ developed on the basis of concepts from critical sociology. Investigating the negotiation of sanctity between Rome and geographically distant areas participates in ‘globalizing’ the history of early modern art and is qualified to challenge established perspectives on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world at large.

Horizon 2020,WoWA,Women Writing Architecture: Female Experiences of the Built 1700-1900,"WoWA studies female experiences of architecture as recorded in documentary writing drawn from specific regions in South America and Europe between 1700 and 1900. While architectural histories often focus on male-dominated processes of design and production, this project takes a new stance by unearthing women’s contributions to the architectural sphere through writing and editing. While not part of the canon, articles, travelogues, domestic manuals, or pamphlets authored by women in the period consistently featured descriptions of or commentary on buildings and cities, but these have never been examined collectively by architectural historians. Through a combination of macro and micro research, close and distant reading, geographical mapping and tracing of experience, WoWA addresses this gap opening up a new corpus and presenting architecture’s past through the female eye. 
I suggest that, by exploring women’s writing, we can uncover female agency within architecture in a period that has thus far been considered as male governed. I believe that architectural history as a discipline has to look beyond the production of buildings to processes of reception and appropriation in order to fully understand the past of the built environment as experienced and shaped by colonised groups, such as women. Over a period of dramatic social, political, technological, and architectural transformations on both sides of the Atlantic, WoWA explores specific case studies of women documenting both everyday experiences of built spaces as well as canonical architectural events. Interdisciplinary in method and scope and employing feminist approaches focusing on modes of writing, voice, and subjective experience, the team of PI, Postdoc, and PhD will expose female publics of architecture in and between Chile, Peru, Argentina, Britain, and German-speaking Europe a time of industrialisation, colonisation and revolution, nation building and independence, historicism and professionalisation.",Anne Hultzsch,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich),Switzerland,-,949525,ERC-2020-STG,Starting Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),SH5 - Cultures & Cultural Production,2020,44228,46234,1454735,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/949525,ETH Zurich
Horizon 2020,BETLIV,Returning to a Better Place: The (Re)assessment of the ‘Good Life’ in Times of Crisis,"What makes for a valuable and good life is a question that many people in the contemporary world ask themselves, yet it is one that social science research has seldom addressed. Only recently have scholars started undertaking inductive comparative research on different notions of the ‘good life’, highlighting socio-cultural variations and calling for a better understanding of the different imaginaries, aspirations and values that guide people in their quest for better living conditions. Research is still lacking, however, on how people themselves evaluate, compare, and put into perspective different visions of good living and their socio-cultural anchorage. This project addresses such questions from an anthropological perspective, proposing an innovative study of how ideals of the good life are articulated, (re)assessed, and related to specific places and contexts as a result of the experience of crisis and migration. The case studies chosen to operationalize these lines of enquiry focus on the phenomenon of return migration, and consist in an analysis of the imaginaries and experience of return by Ecuadorian and Cuban men and women who migrated to Spain, are dissatisfied with their life there, and envisage/carry out the project of going back to their countries of origin (Ecuador and Cuba respectively). The project’s ambition is to bring together and contribute to three main scholarly areas of enquiry: 1) the study of morality, ethics and what counts as ‘good life’, 2) the study of the field of economic practice, its definition, value regimes, and ‘crises’, and 3) the study of migratory aspirations, projects, and trajectories. A multi-sited endeavour, the research is designed in three subprojects carried out in Spain (PhD student), Ecuador (Post-Doc), and Cuba (PI), in which ethnographic methods will be used to provide the first empirically grounded study of the links between notions and experiences of crisis, return migration, and the (re)assessment of good living.",Valerio Simoni Riba,Foundation for International Relations and Development Studies,Switzerland,-,759649,ERC-2017-STG,Starting Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),SH5 - Cultures & Cultural Production,2017,43132,45138,1500000,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/759649,Foundation for International Relations and Development Studies
Horizon 2020,Global Horizons,Global Horizons in Pre-Modern Art,"The horizon is the line that seems to separate earth from sky, the line that divides all visible categories into two categories: those that intersect the earth’s surface and those that do not. The horizon is key to the experience of space; it defines our perspective on the visible world. The GLOBAL HORIZONS project will investigate the historical meanings and functions of the horizon in visual and intellectual cultures of the pre-Modern world on a global scale. Examining how pre-Modern cultures conceived of the horizon opens a crucial line of inquiry into understanding the many different ways in which humans have conceived of the relationship between an invisible cosmos and the visible world. Non-western art history is rarely taught at European institutions although countless important works of Non-Western art are kept in museum collections all across Europe. Including non-western concepts of pictorial space is key to the project, however, for Eurocentric models of art history have generally privileged the rise of the linear perspective. This framing has limited our understanding of the horizon’s complex rhetorical, visual and epistemological roles. The project’s specific question connects a variety of objects and epistemological categories, such as panel painting, manuscript illumination, profane und religious objects, cartography, travel accounts, and cosmological treaties. The applied methodological approaches will range from art history, visual studies and cultural anthropology. They will also draw upon interdisciplinary expertise, such as technologies of art production, history of science and philosophy.  The project thus makes an important contribution to global art history, a highly innovative area in which only very few pre-modern topics have been addressed. It is the ultimate goal of GLOBAL HORIZONS is to suggest a new history of representation in Western medieval art. ",Beate Fricke,University of Bern,Switzerland,-,771383,ERC-2017-COG,Consolidator Grants,Social sciences & humanities (SH),SH5 - Cultures & Cultural Production,2017,43344,45351,1904188,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/771383,University of Berne
Horizon 2020,DIVLAW,How God Became a Lawgiver: The Place of the Torah in Ancient Near Eastern Legal History,"The Torah’s notion of divine law fundamentally transforms the nature of law found in its ancient Near Eastern context. Typically kings—not gods—took on the role of the promulgation of laws. The Torah’s conception of God as lawgiver emerged gradually through historical processes, rather than constituting the bedrock of the Bible’s literary and legal history. And, while scholars have long recognized the uniqueness of the Torah’s conception, its early historical development has received little attention. Only tangential analysis exists on the forces surrounding the genesis of the Torah’s notion of divine laws within ancient Near Eastern legal history or its impact on religion and politics in the early historical contexts of ancient Israel and Judah. 
This project therefore aims: 1) to explicate the anchoring of law in the religious ether of the Ancient Near East; 2) to elucidate for the first time the intellectual processes in ancient Israel and Judah that led to the notion of divine laws and God as lawgiver, drawing comparisons with other legal understandings and practices from the ancient Near East; 3) to assess the socio-political and religious impact of this notion with ancient Judaism through the Hellenistic Period; and 4) to contextualize this development in the ancient world in comparison to parallel developments in Greek polities. 
The project’s innovative potential lies in: 1) the evaluation of the divine laws as a historical phenomenon; 2) the neglected effort to understand their intellectual genesis and early development in a reciprocal relation to their socio-political context; 3) the cross-cultural analysis of ancient Israel and Judah and its neighbouring cultures in this regard; and 4) the application of a longue durée and realgeschichtliche perspective to largely literary and philological disciplines. These investigations offer a new paradigm for elucidating the webs connecting divinity, law, and socio-political developments in the first millennium BCE.
